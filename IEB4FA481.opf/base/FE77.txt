mañjuśrīvikrīḍito nāma mahāyānasūtraḥ The Miraculous Play of Mañjuśrī
Translation on the basis of the Tibetan and Chinese versions.
I. Thus I heard: Once the Lord stayed at the Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha with a great congregation of some five hundred monks and with eight thousand bodhisatvas (evaṃ mayā śrutam ekasmin samaye bhagavān rājagṛhe viharati sma gṛdhrakuṭe parvate mahatā bhikṣusaṃghena sārdhaṃ pañcamātrair bhikṣuśatair aṣṭābhiś1 ca bodhisatvasahasraiḥ).All [the bodhisatvas] were great beings (mahāsatva) having acquired the power of retaining in memory (dhāraṇīpratilabdha) and immeasurable eloquence (apramāṇapratibhāna), what discursive2 knowledge they might establish is the noble knowledge (āryajñāna) of the three gates of liberation (vimokṣamukha), their knowledge was unobstructed in the three worlds (trilokāpratihatajñāna), their concentration (samādhi) was undisturbed, and they had perfected the ten powers and intrepidities (daśabalavaiśāradyasaṃpanna).3
At that time, in the great city of Rājagṛha, lived the daughter of a courtesan called Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī4 , beautiful, charming and good-looking, she had the most abundant riches of a beautiful complexion (tena khalu samayena rājagṛhe mahānagare suvarṇottaraprabhāśrī nāma gaṇikāduhitā5 prativasaty abhirūpā prāsādikā darśanīyā paramayā śubhavarṇapuṣkalatayā samanvāgatā6 ).By her former roots of good that girl had attained a colour of the body like the colour of gold (tasyāś ca dārikāyāḥ pūrvakuśalamūlahetunā suvarṇavarṇaḥ kāyo ’bhiniṣpannaḥ),and whatever place she was standing, sitting or walking would be illumined by the splendour of that golden colour (yeṣu pṛthivīpradeśeṣu tiṣṭhaty api niṣaṇṇāpi gacchaty api te ’pi suvarṇavarṇāvabhāsenāvabhāsitāḥ),and, whatever clothing she would put on, be it red or white, would shine with a golden colour (yāni vastrāṇi tayā veṣṭhitāni lohitāni vāvadātāni vā tāni ca sarvāṇi vastrāṇi suvarṇavarṇāny eva saṃdṛśyante).That girl was the beloved and comforting friend of all people (sā ca dārikā sarvasya janakāyasya priyā viśvastamānasā), and they could not get enough of looking at her (nirīkṣamāṇo na tṛptim upayāti).7She had such a gentle speech (suvacāḥ), her speech was tender, soft, sweet and pleasant (sūratamṛdumadhurapriyavādinī), and her face was smiling (smitamukhā), worthy of all respect (supradakṣiṇagrāhiṇī), having no aggressions (apagatabhṛkuṭikā), no harshness (aparuṣā) or roughness (akarkaśā);and all the young princes (rājaputra), the young sons of ministers (āmātyaputra), young sons of bankers (śreṣṭhiputra), young sons of housholders (gṛhapatiputra) in the great city of Rājagṛha desired her excessively, having their minds bent on her they did not know how to see her enough.And wherever that daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī went, be it to gardens, to rivers, lotus-ponds (udyānanadīpuṣkariṇī), to houses, roads, to the marketplace (gṛharathyāntarāpaṇa), men and women, boys and girls (naranārīdārakadārikāḥ) assembled and followed her (tasyāḥ pṛṣṭhato ’nubaddhāḥ) out of curiosity (kautūhalaprāptāḥ).
Then a son of a banker (śreṣṭhiputra) named Bhayadatta got hold of Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī, the daughter of a courtesan, by means of riches.Setting out for a garden (udyānabhūmau niryāntau) they sat down on a nice seat which had been prepared (prajñapta eva svāsane niṣaṇṇau) in a cart with four horses, decorated with jewels, pearls, cats-eye gems and gold (maṇimuktikāvaiḍūryasuvarṇasvalaṃkṛta), carrying raised parasols, flags and banners (samucchritacchattradhvajapatāka), adorned with flowers, incense, perfume, aromatic powder and garlands (puṣpadhūpagandhacūrṇamālopaśobhita), with windows adorned with campaka-flowers (campakamālāvātāyana).And thus, with the intention of playing and having fun (ratikrīḍāśayena), before the cart people were leading it on with cymbals, drums, (rathasya purato tūryatāḍāvacarasaṃgītipravādena nīyamānaḥ), and those following it carried all kinds of things for enjoyment and pleasure (tasya rathasya pṛṣṭhataḥ sarvâpabhogaparibhogadhāry anusārī). The great crowd of people followed with thoughts set on seeing the object of their curiosity, and they thus arrived in the garden (mahājanakāyaḥ kautūhaladarśanāśayaḥ pṛṣṭhato ’nubaddha udyānabhūmim upajagāma).
II. Then the princely Mañjuśrī came out of his meditative absorption, and generating great compassion for all living beings he thought (atha mañjuśrīḥ kumārbhūtaḥ pratisaṃlayanād vyutthāya sarvasatveṣu mahākaruṇām utpādya tasyābhavat):“Who are the living beings who can be brought to maturity in this great way by means of miracles of magic, the miracle of teachings or the miracle of admonition?” (ke satvā ye etasmin mahāyāna ṛddhiprātihāryeṇa vādeśanāprātihāryeṇa vānuśāsanīprātihāryeṇa paripācayitavyā iti).And the princely Mañjuśrī saw the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī having mounted the cart with the son of a banker Bhayadatta to go to the park (mañjuśrīḥ kumārabhūtaḥ suvarṇottaraprabhāśriyaṃ gaṇikāduhitāraṃ bhayadattena śreṣṭhiputreṇa sārdhaṃ ratham ārūḍhām udyānabhūmiṃ gacchatīṃ dadarśa).Having seen her he considered her ability, her power and vigour for being trained, and finding her as possessing the power of earlier roots of good and the ability of understanding (dṛṣṭvā ca vineyārthaṃ tasyā indriyabalavīryaviśeṣaṃ vyavalokayan tāṃ pūrvakuśalamūlājñendriyabalādhānāṃ viditvā), the princely Mañjuśrī produced such a miracle of magic, a miracle by which (atha mañjuśrīḥ kumārabhūtas tathārūpam ṛddhyabhisaṃskāram abhisaṃskaroti sma yathārūpeṇābhisaṃskāreṇābhisaṃskṛtena) he overpowered even the light of both the sun and the moon as soon as he showed himself, so what then about [the light] of other beings (kiṃ tv anyeṣāṃ satvānām)!And having transformed himself (ātmānam abhinirmāya) in that way, he showed himself as wearing a shining garment (vastra), the lustre of which illuminated a circle a yojana across, and he showed himself as wearing all kinds of ornaments (sarvabhūṣaṇavibhūṣita).Then the princely Mañjuśrī, wearing that garment and adorned with all those ornaments, sat down by the road where the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī was coming.
And as soon as the princely Mañjuśrī sat down there, the cart of the banker’s son was darkened (dhyāmīkṛta), and even the whole body of the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī was darkened.Just as (tad yathā) if you put something soaked with ink (maṣī) beside gold from the Jambu river (jāmbūnadasuvarṇa), it does not shine, it is not bright, not radiant (na bhāsate na tapate na virocate), in the same way (evam eva), as the light from the body of the princely Mañjuśrī touched the body of the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī did not shine, was not bright, not radiant.
The daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī saw the princely Mañjuśrī sitting there, looking like a divine youth (devaputrakumāra), his body adorned with ornaments, clothed in the shining garment, and the light emanating from that garment.And as soon she had seen him, a feeling of contempt (avamanyanāsaṃjñā) for her own body arose in her, and a feeling of inferiority (hīnasaṃjñā), and she conceived a desire for possessing (abhilaṣagrāhyasaṃjñā) that garment.She thought: “I have had enough of this banker’s son, I will alight from this cart to amuse myself, play and be with this [man instead] (tena sārdhaṃ rame krīḍāmi paricārayāmi), then I also can ask him for that garment.”
But as soon as the girl had made that thought, the great divine king (mahārāja) Vaiśravaṇa, who had transformed himself into a man (manuṣyarūpam ātmānam abhinirmāya) with the help of the magic (adhiṣṭhāna) of the princely Mañjuśrī, told that girl:– Girl (dārike), do not make thoughts of passion (saṃraktacitta) towards this good man (satpuruṣa)! Why? Because he never seeks pleasure (tatkāmānarthikatvāt).The girl said: – Who is he? What is his name?Vaiśravaṇa said: – He is a bodhisatva, and he is called the princely Mañjuśrī (mañjuśrīkumārabhūta).The girl said: – But what then, is a bodhisatva? Is it a god, or is it a snake-god, a demon, a celstial musician, giant, divine bird, man-horse, great serpent, a king of the gods or a creator god, a world protector or a great king? What is a bodhisatva? (tad bodhisatva iti kiṃ? kiṃ tad deva āhosvin nāgo vā yakṣo vā gandharvo vāsuro vā garuḍo vā kiṃnaro vā mahorago vā śakro vā brahmā vā lokapālo vā maharājaḥ? tad bodhisatva iti kiṃ?)Vaiśravaṇa said: – Girl, a bodhisatva is not a god, not a snake-god, not a demon, not a celstial musician, not a giant, not a divine bird, not a man-horse, not a great serpent, not a king of the gods or a creator god, not a world protector or a great king.Girl, he is one who fulfills the wishes of all beings (sarvasatvāśayaparipūrin), that is why he is called a bodhisatva,he is one who gives to all who beg (sarvayācakānāṃ dāyakaḥ) and does not send away anybody, that is why he is called a bodhisatva.
Then the girl thought: “According to those words he will give me this garment,” and after the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī had alighted from the cart, she adressed herself to the princely Mañjuśrī:– Mañjuśrī, please give me the garment in which your body is clothed!Having been adressed thus the princely Mañjuśrī spoke to the girl in the following way (evam uktaś ca mañjuśrīḥ kumārabhūtas tāṃ dārikām uvāca):– Sister, if you produce the thought of awakening, I will give you this garment (bodhicittaṃ bhagini tvam utpādayer ahaṃ cedaṃ vastraṃ te dāsyāmi).The girl said (dārikovāca): – What then, Mañjuśrī, is ‘awakening’ (bodhir iti mañjuśrīs tat kiṃ)?Mañjuśrī said (mañjuśrīr uvāca): – Sister, you are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bhagini bodhiḥ).The girl said (dārikovāca): – How, Mañjuśrī, am I the awakening, I do not understand the sense of what you say (kathaṃ mañjuśry ahaṃ bodhiḥ, na tvadbhāṣitasyārthaṃ jānāmi).Then she spoke the following verse (atha khalv imāṃ gāthām abhāṣata):
– If you have entered the awakening, Mañjughoṣa, you should give me this garment (cīvara); a stingy (matsarin) bodhisatva has no beauty, he is like a dried up river where there is no water.
Mañjuśrī said:
– If you, my girl, enter the awakening, I will give you this garment today, because even the whole world – including the gods – finds worthy of offering those who unswervingly (acalita) stay with the thought of awakening (bodhicitta).
The girl said:
– So what, then, is the meaning of the word (padārtha) awakening (bodhi)? From whom is it attained? Who will grant it? In which religious groups (gaṇa) is it taught (nirdiṣṭa)? Let those not clever (akuśala), those without understanding (anadhigata) understand!
----------
III. Mañjuśrī said: – Sister, this is the religious teaching of the present true being worthy of offerings, the perfectly awakened one named Śākyamuni (iyaṃ bhagini tasya śākyamuner nāma sthitasya tathāgatasyārhataḥ samyaksaṃbuddhasya dharmadeśanā):“As the body partakes in universal sameness, awakening also partakes in universal sameness; as awakening partakes in universal sameness, the body also partakes in universal sameness” (kāyasamatayā bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā kāyasamatā),that is why I tell you, sister: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.But what is your opinion, sister, this body of yours, is it made up of parts of the personality, of spheres and fields of perception (tat kiṃ manyase bhaginy ayaṃ tvatkāyaḥ skandhadhātvāyatanābhinirvṛtto bhavati)?As the girl had heard this teaching the light of religion was born in her (dharmālokajātā) as the outcome of earlier roots of good (pūrvakuśalamūlaniṣyanda), and having attained that light, she told Mañjuśrī:– That is the way it is, Mañjuśrī, this body of mine is made up of parts of the personality, of spheres and fields of perception (evam etan mañjuśrīr ayaṃ matkāyaḥ skandhadhātvāyatanābhinirvṛtto bhavati).
Mañjuśrī said: – But, sister, what is your opinion, is there mental activity or consciousness in form (tat kiṃ manyase bhagini rūpe cetanā vā vijñānaṃ vā bhavati)?The girl said: – Not at all, Mañjuśrī (no hīdaṃ mañjuśrīḥ).Mañjuśrī said: – Also the awakening, sister, is without mental activity (acetanā?) and without consciousness (nirvijñāna?).Thus, sister, as form partakes in universal sameness, awakening also partakes in universal sameness; as awakening partakes in universal sameness, form also partakes in universal sameness” (rūpasamatayā bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā rūpasamatā);sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
But sister, what is your opinion, is there mental activity or consciousness in feelings, perception, conditioning forces and in consciousness (tat kiṃ manyase bhagini vedanāyāṃ ca saṃjñāyāṃ ca saṃskāre ca vijñāne ca cetanā vā vijñānaṃ vā bhavati)?The girl said: – Not at all, Mañjuśrī (no hīdaṃ mañjuśrīḥ).Mañjuśrī said: – Also the awakening, sister, is without mental activity (acetanā?) and without consciousness (nirvijñāna?).Thus, sister, as consciousness partakes in universal sameness, awakening also partakes in universal sameness; as awakening partakes in universal sameness, consciousness also partakes in universal sameness (vijñānasamatayā bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā vijñānasamatā);sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
[Then follows the same argument connected to a list of abhidharma-concepts as found in most mahāyānasūtras: Form (rupa) is not something within (adhyātma), nor something on the outside (bahirdhā), nor neither (nobhaya), it is not possible to demonstrate the existence of forms in any place (viṣaya) or any direction (diś) as having a colour etc.; this is also the case with bodhi, and the two are thus identical. The same goes for the four remaining skandhas, and, quote, “Sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself“.”]
----------
Further, sister, the five parts of the personality are like a magical creation, they originate from nothing, from misunderstanding, nothing but an unexistent and misleading conventional expression (punar aparaṃ bhagini pañcaskandhā māyopamā asadviparyāsotpannā asadviparyāsavyavahārāḥ); and also the awakening is like a magical creation, nothing but an unexistent and misleading conventional expression (bodhir api bhagini māyopamāsadviparyāsavyavahārā).Thus, sister, as a magical creation partakes in universal sameness, the parts of personality partakes in universal sameness; as the parts of personality partakes in universal sameness, a magical creation partakes in universal sameness (māyāsamatayā skandhasamatā, skandhasamatayā māyāsamatā); as a magical creation partakes in universal sameness, awakening partakes in universal sameness; as awakening partakes in universal sameness, a magical creation partakes in universal sameness (māyāsamatayā bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā māyāsamatā);sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
[Same conclusion (tvam eva bodhir iti) on the basis of the following arguments concerned with some of the other similes for demonstrating the irreality of the skandhas: The parts of the personality (skandha) are like a dream (svapnopama), not at all brought into being (atyantānabhinirvṛtta), awakening is also not brought into being as having the same nature as a dream (svapnasvabhāva); the skandhas are like mirage (marīcyupama) arisen through bewildered action (bhrāntakarma) (as when lost in the desert?), and awakening also has the essence of a mirage (marīcisvabhāva) since beyond the maturation (vipāka) of action; the skandhas are like a reflection in a mirror (pratibimbopama), not disappearing (acyuta) (as long as the image mirrored is there?), thus also bodhi, which has the essence of a reflection (pratibimbasvabhāva). (Tib. p. 530-66, Dh p. 818a9-17, Na p. 826b10-20)]
----------
----------
Further, sister, the parts of personality (skandha) are only a word (nāmamātra), and that word is neutral (aniñja); and sister, the awakening (bodhi) is also a word (nāmamātra), and that word is neutral (aniñja).Thus, sister, as the neutral partakes in universal sameness, the parts of personality partakes in universal sameness; as the parts of personality partakes in universal sameness, the neutral partakes in universal sameness (aniñjasamatayā skandhasamatā, skandhasamatayā aniñjasamatā); as the neutral partakes in universal sameness, awakening partakes in universal sameness; as awakening partakes in universal sameness, the neutral partakes in universal sameness (aniñjasamatayā bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā aniñjasamatā);sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
Further, sister, among the parts of personality there is no acting subject, and the meaning of being unmade is awakening (punar aparaṃ bhagini na skandheṣu kārakaḥ, akṛtakārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is no proper nature and the meaning of being without a proper nature is awakening (na skandheṣu svabhāvaḥ, niḥsvabhāvārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is no origination, and the meaning of being non-originated is awakening (na skandheṣūtpādaḥ, anutpannārthas tu bodhiḥ), among the parts of personality there is no permanence, and the meaning of being without permanence is awakening (na skandheṣu nityatā, anityārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is no happiness, and the meaning of suffering is awakening (na skandheṣu sukham, duḥkhārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is nothing pure, and the meaning of impurity is awakening (na skandheṣu śubham, aśubhārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is no self, and the meaning of selflessness is awakening (na skandheṣv ātmā, anātmārthas tu bodhiḥ).Further, sister, among the parts of personality there is no development, and the meaning of being being beyond development is awakening (punar aparaṃ, bhagini, na skandheṣv abhinirvṛttiḥ, anabhinirvṛttārthas tu bodhiḥ); the parts of personality are something apart, and the meaning of being something apart is awakening (skandhā viviktāḥ, viviktārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is nothing to grasp, and the meaning of being beyond grasping is awakening (na skandheṣa grāhyaḥ, agrāhyārthas tu bodhiḥ); (Na 826c) among the parts of personality there is no support, and the meaning of being without support is awakening (na skandheṣv āśrayaḥ, anāśrayārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is no going or coming, and the meaning of being beyond coming and going is awakening (na skandheṣv āgamanirgamau, anāgamanirgamārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is nothing remaining in the present, and the meaning of not remaining in the present is awakening (na skandheṣu pratyutpannasthitiḥ, apratyutpannasthityarthas tu bodhiḥ).Further, sister, the parts of the personality (skandha) are only a holy conventional expression (āryavyavahāra), and also the awakening (bodhi) is a holy conventional expression (āryavyavahāra); the parts of personality are essentially beyond conventional expressions, and the awakening is beyond conventional expressions (skandhā vyavahārasvabhāvāḥ, bodhir apy avyavahārā); what is the essential nature of the five parts of personality, that is the essential nature of the all the moments of existence penetrated by the True Being, and that is awakening (yatsvabhāvāś ca pañcaskandhās tatsvabhāvāḥ sarvatathāgatādhigatadharmāḥ sā bodhir iti). In this way, sister, the essential nature of the parts of the personality (Dh 818b) is the essential nature of awakening, (evam eva bhagini skandhasvabhāvo bodhisvabhāvaḥ), and the essential nature of awakening is the essential nature of all moments of existence (bodhisvabhāvaḥ sarvadharmasvabhāvaḥ), sister, what is the essential nature of the five parts of personality, what is the essential nature of awakening, that is the essential nature of all beings (yatsvabhāvaḥ pañcaskandhā yatsvabhāvā ca bodhis tatsvabhāvāḥ sarvasatvāḥ), and, sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
Further, sister, what is understanding the parts of the personality, that, certainly, is awakening (punar aparaṃ bhagini yaḥ skandhāvabodhaḥ saiva bodhiḥ), there is no [real] understanding not including the parts of the personality, there is no [real] understanding not including the awakening (na skandhāparyāpanno ’vabodho na ca bodhyaparyāpanno ’vabodhaḥ), thus what is understanding is awakening (evam eva yo ’vabodhaḥ sā bodhiḥ); sister, that is why I tell you: "You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)". Sister, you should know things according to this teaching (paryāya): As all beings are included in the awakening (sarvasattvā bodhiparyāpannāḥ), that teaching not included anywhere (aparyāpannopadeśa) is the awakening (bodhi), sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
Further, sister, in this body of yours the four elements are produced (abhinirvṛtta), namely, the element of earth (pṛthivīdhātu), the element of water (abdhātu), the element of fire (tejodhātu) and the element of wind (vāyudhātu), and sister, the element of earth is not the self, not the being itself, not then life-principle, not the spirit, not the reincarnating individual (pṛthivīdhātus tu nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalaḥ), and also the awakening is not the self, not the being itself, not then life-principle, not the spirit, not the reincarnating individual (bodhir api nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalaḥ). Thus also the element of water, the element of fire and the element of wind are not the self, not the being itself, not then life-principle, not the spirit, not the reincarnating individual (evam abdhātus tejodhātur vāyudhātur nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalaḥ), and also the awakening is not the self, not the being itself, not then life-principle, not the spirit, not the reincarnating individual (bodhir api nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalaḥ). The element of earth and the awakening are the same because of their absolute sameness to empty space (pṛthivīdhātur bodhiś ca samā atyantākāśasamatvāt); the element of water and the awakening are the same because of their absolute non-existence (abdhātur bodhiś ca samā atyantābhāvatvāt); the element of fire and the awakening are the same because of their absolute neutrality (tejodhātur bodhiś ca samā atyantāniñjyatvāt); the element of wind and the awakening are the same because of being absolutely beyond demonstration (vāyudhātur bodhiś ca samā atyantānidarśanatvāt). What is the element of earth, sister, that element is known and understood by The True Being (yo pṛthivīdhātur bhagini so dhātus tathāgatena jñāto ’bhisamāgataḥ); what is the element of water, sister, that element is known and understood by The True Being (yo ’bdhātur bhagini so dhātus tathāgatena jñāto ’bhisamāgataḥ); what is the element of fire, sister, that element is known and understood by The True Being (yas tejodhātur bhagini so dhātus tathāgatena jñāto ’bhisamāgataḥ); what is the element of wind, sister, that element is known and understood by The True Being (yo vāyudhātur bhagini so dhātus tathāgatena jñāto ’bhisamāgataḥ); and sister, understanding the element of earth is awakening (pṛthivīdhātvavabodho bodhiḥ), thus, sister, understanding the element of water, the element of fire and the element of wind is awakening (evaṃ bhaginy abdhātutejodhātuvāyudhātvavabodho bodhiḥ); sister, that is why I tell you: "You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)". Sister, the element of earth does not know the element of water (pṛthivīhātur bhagini nābdhātuṃ saṃjānāti); the element of water does not know the element of fire (abdhātur na tejodhātuṃ saṃjānāti); the element of fire does not know the element of wind (tejodhātur na vāyudhātuṃ saṃjānāti); in that way, sister, thorough knowledge of the word element is called awakening (tathā bhagini yā dhātunām aparijñā sā bodhir iti); sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
Further, sister, in this body of yours the eye (cakṣus) is produced (abhinirvṛtta), and in the same way, the ear (śrotra), nose (ghrāṇa), body (kāya), tongue (jihvā) and mind (manas) are produced (abhinirvṛtta); but sister, the eye is empty (cakṣur bhagini śūnyam), and the essential nature of the eye, being emptiness, is awakening (cakṣuḥśūnyatāsvabhāvo bodhiḥ); [same for the remaining senses, with the conclusion “You are the awakening yourself”].
Further, sister, the emptiness of the eye does not communicate [constructed concepts of] form (punar aparaṃ bhagini yā cakṣuḥśūnyatā na sā rūpaṃ prajñāpayati), and the essential nature of empty form is awakening (śūnyasya rūpasya svabhāvo bodhiḥ); [same for the remaining senses, with the conclusion "You are the awakening yourself"]. Sister, thus the eye does not grasp form, as also the awakening does not grasp form (na tu cakṣū rūpaṃ gṛhṇāti na bodhir api rūpaṃ gṛhṇāti); [same for the remaining senses]. And what, sister, is the reason for this (tad bhagini kasya hetoḥ)? The eye not connected to a form is awakening, and, similarly with the other senses, the mind not connected to a moment of existence is awakening (cakṣū rūpāpagataṃ bodhir yāvan mano dharmāpagataṃ bodhiḥ). Thus, sister, the sphere of eye-consciousness is something not connected to the sphere of form, and the sphere of eye-consciousness not connected to a form is awakening (evaṃ bhagini yaś cakṣurvijñānadhātuḥ so rūpadhātvapratisandhikaḥ, cakṣurvijñānadhātū rūpadhātvapagato bodhiḥ). [Same for the remaining senses, with the conclusion "You are the awakening yourself"]. Thus, sister, the awakening and sphere of eye-consciousness are beyond duality and not distinguishable as two entities (evaṃ bhagini bodhiś cakṣurvijñānadhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ), the awakening and sphere of form are beyond duality and not distinguishable as two entities (bodhiḥ rūpadhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ); as the awakening and sphere of mind are beyond duality and not distinguishable as two entities (yāvad bodhir manodhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ), the awakening and sphere of moments of existrence are beyond duality and not distinguishable as two entities (bodhir dharmadhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ); the awakening and sphere of mind-consciousness are beyond duality and not distinguishable as two entities (bodhir manovijñānadhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ); sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
Further, sister, understanding the eye is awakening, and, similarly, understanding hearing, smelling, tasting, body and mind is awakening (punar aparaṃ bhagini cakṣuravabodho bodhir evaṃ śrotraghrāṇajihvākāyamano’vabodho bodhiḥ); the essential nature of the eye is empty, and this empty essential nature is awakening, and, similarly, the essential nature of hearing, smelling, tasting, body and mind is empty, and this empty essential nature is awakening (cakṣuḥsvabhāvaḥ śūnyaḥ sa śūnyasvabhāvo bodhir evaṃ śrotraghrāṇajihvākāyamanaḥsvabhāvaḥ śūnyaḥ sa śūnyasvabhāvo bodhiḥ).Sister, the essential nature of the eye is beyond desire, aversion and bewilderment, and what is without desire, aversion and bewilderment is awakening (cakṣuḥsvabhāvo bhaginy araktādviṣṭāmūḍhaḥ, rāgadveṣamohāpagatā tu bodhiḥ); the essential nature of the hearing, smelling, tasting, body and mind is beyond desire, aversion and bewilderment, and what is without desire, aversion and bewilderment is awakening (śrotraghrāṇajihvākāyamanaḥsvabhāvo ’raktādviṣṭāmūḍhaḥ, rāgadveṣamohāpagatā tu bodhiḥ).Sister, the eye is without owner, owned or the act of owning, the awakening is also owner, owned or tha act of owning (cakṣur bhaginy asvāmikam amamam aparigrahakam, bodhir api asvāmikāmamāparigrahikā); [same for the other senses].Sister, the eye is not connected to the condition of being a man, it is not connected to the condition of a being a woman (cakṣur bhagini na puruṣadharmasamprayuktaṃ nāpi strīdharmasamprayuktam); and, sister, awakening is not connected to the condition of being a man, it is not connected to the condition of a being a woman (bodhir bhagini na puruṣadharmasamprayuktaṃ nāpi strīdharmasamprayuktam). [Same for the other senses.] Sister, the eye is not a man, it is not a woman (cakṣur bhagini na puruṣo nāpi strī), and, sister, awakening is not a man, it is not a woman (bodhir bhagini na puruṣo nāpi strī); as, sister, the mind is not a man, it is not a woman (mano bhagini na puruṣo nāpi strī), and, sister, awakening is not a man, it is not a woman (bodhir bhagini na puruṣo nāpi strī). Sister, thus the Real Being understands the reality of the eye, and this understanding is awakening (tathā bhagini cakṣustathatā tathāgatenādhigatā, tathatāvabodhas tu bodhiḥ), as the Real Being understands the reality of the mind, and this understanding is awakening (yāvan manastathatā tathāgatenādhigatā, tathatāvabodhas tu bodhiḥ). Sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
Further, sister, this body of yours is not a self, not an animated being, not a life-principle, not a spirit, not a personality, not a human, not a man, not a creator, not a subject of feeling, knowing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, not a subject of consciousness (punar aparaṃ bhagini tvatkāyo ’yaṃ nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalo na manujo na mānavo na kārako na vedako na jñātā na draṣṭā na śrotā na ghrātā na bhoktā na spraṣṭā na vijñātā); sister, also awakening is not a self, not an animated being, not a life-principle, not a spirit, not a personality, not a human, not a man, not a creator, not a subject of feeling, knowing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, not a subject of consciousness (nāpi bodhir ātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalo na manujo na mānavo na kārako na vedako na jñātā na draṣṭā na śrotā na ghrātā na bhoktā na spraṣṭā na vijñātā). Thus, sister, the universal sameness of all moments of existence is awakening (evaṃ bhagini sarvadharmasamatā bodhiḥ).Sister, this body of yours is neutral, without an acting subject and impermanent, it is not distinct and different from grass, wood, trees and building material of stone (yo bhagini tvatkāyo ’niñjyo ’kārako ’nityaḥ, tṛṇakāṣṭavṛkṣabhittigaṇāviśiṣṭāprabhinnaḥ). And, sister, the inner element of earth and the outer element of earth are not two and not distinguishable as two entities (yo bhaginy adhyātmapṛthivīdhātur bāhyapṛthivīdhātuś cādvayau dvayāprabhedau), and as such they have the one characteristic of being without characteristics (evam alakṣaṇāv ekalakṣaṇau) when understood by the Tathāgata through his insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna). Sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
Further, sister, the experience in thoughts, mind and consciousness by which exist intention, the thoughts of consciousness and the experince in thought and consciousness, does not abide in the hair, not in the hair on the body, not in the cuticle, not in the skin, not in the flesh, not in the blood, not in the bones, not in the sinews, not in the marrow, not inside, not outside, not in neither of them, not in the eye, not in the ear, not in the nose, not in the tongue, not in the bod, not in the mind, does not abide, does not not abide, it is not discontinuity, does not abide in an area, not in any direction (punar aparaṃ bhagini yayā cittamanovijñānavijñaptyā cetanā vijñānacittam manovijñānavijñaptiḥ sā na keśe tiṣṭhati, na rome tiṣṭhati, na chavau tiṣṭhati, na tvaci tiṣṭhati, na māṃse tiṣṭhati, na rudhire tiṣṭhati, na asthau tiṣṭhati, na naharau(?Mvy) tiṣṭhati, na majjāyāṃ tiṣṭhati, nādhyātme tiṣṭhati, na bāhye tiṣṭhati, na nobhaye tiṣṭhati, na cakṣuṣi tiṣṭhati, na śrotre tiṣṭhati, na ghrāṇe tiṣṭhati, na jihvāyāṃ tiṣṭhati, na kāye tiṣṭhati, na manasi tiṣṭhati, na na tiṣṭhati, nāvacchedaḥ, na gocare tiṣṭhati, na deśe tiṣṭhati), it is without form, not possible to demonstrate, beyond experience, ungraspable, unmixed, without basis, pure, clean and brilliant (arūpiny anirdeśyāvijñaptir agrahyā niḥsaṃsargānāśrayā śuddhā śuciḥ prabhāsvarā); that experience in thoughts and mind is beyond the impurity of vices and also beyond purity (sā cittamanovijñaptir asaṃkliṣṭānavadātā), it is since it is without body in being essentially pure and brilliant that it beyond the impurity of vices and also beyond purity (sā svabhāvena viśuddhaprabhāsvare ’śarīratvād asaṃkliṣṭānavadātā).
Thus, sister, the essential nature of the parts of the personality, the spheres and the fields of perception is the awakening, and the essential nature of awakening is the parts of the personality, the spheres and the fields of perception (evaṃ bhagini skandhadhātvāyatanasvabhāvas tu bodhiḥ, bodhisvabhāvo ’pi skandhadhātvāyatanāni). And, sister, the parts of the personality, the spheres and the fields of perception as developed in your body is the awakening, the awakening is nothing else (asmin bhagini tvatkāye yāni skandhadhātvāyatanāny abhinirvṛttāni sā bodhir, nānyā bodhiḥ). Why? Awakening is nothing else than the parts of the personality, the spheres and the fields of perception, these, indeed, are awakening – since understanding the sameness of all moments of existence is awakening (tat kasya hetor, bodhir na skandhadhātvāyatanabhyo ’nyā, tāny eva bodhiḥ, sarvadharmasamatāvabodhas tu bodhiḥ). Sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.
As the princely Mañjuśrī had taught this teaching, five hundred sons of gods in the firmament produced the thought of the incomparable perfect awakening; among the men, women, boys and girls in the entourage of Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī two hundred beings produced the thought of the incomparable perfect awakening; and sixty gods and men attained the stainless, impeccable and pure sight of religion.
IV. The courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī was content and elated, delighted and joyful, joy and good temper was born with her, and, having done obeisance with her five limbs by falling down before the feet of the princely Mañjuśrī, having taken refuge in the Buddha, his teachings and his congregation, having adopted a chaste life and the moral commandments, having produced the thought of the incomparable, perfect awakening with determination, she said (suvarṇottaraprabhāśrī gaṇikāduhitā tṛptodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditā prītisaumanasyajātā pañcāṅgaiḥ namaskṛtya mañjuśrīyaḥ kumārabhūtasya caraṇayor nipatya buddhadharmasaṅghān śaraṇaṃ gatvā brahmacaryāṃ śikṣāpadāni ca samādāyādhyāśayenānuttarāyai samyaksaṃbodhaye cittam utpādayitvedam avocat):
And I, Mañjuśrī, having heard your teaching, will produce the thought of the incomparable perfect awakening for the sake of your teaching, for the sake of pity and compassion with all beings, for the sake of not breaking the tradition of the Buddha, for the sake of not breaking the tradition of the religon, for the sake of not breaking the tradition of the congregation (ahaṃ tu, mañjuśrīs, tvadanuśāsanāyai sarvasatvānukampākaruṇāyai buddhavaṃsānupacchedāya dharmavaṃsānupacchedāya saṃghavaṃsānupacchedāya tvadupadeśaṃ śrutvānuttarāyai samyaksaṃbodhaye cittam utpādayiṣyāmi).In the same way, I will teach religion to all beings to make them understand religion (evaṃ dharmapratipattaye sarvasatvebhyo dharmaṃ deśayiṣyāmi).To purify the hindrances originated from sinful actions I will confess each sin according to how it is done (duṣkṛtakarmāvaraṇapariśodhanāyātyayam atyayato deśayiṣye).When beings do not understand that all moments of existence are peaceful and tranquil, they do not understand the essential nature of moments of existence, since they are in the power of misunderstanding preceded by non-fundamental thought and chained to desire by attachment to their bodies (yatra sarvadharmaśāntyupaśāntim anadhigamya ayoniśomanasikārapūrvaṃgamaviparītavaśībhūtāḥ svakāyābhiniveśena rāgasaṃprayuktāḥ satvā na dharmasvabhāvatām adhigacchanti)But, Mañjuśrī, even though this is the case, also those beings chained to desire are attached to exactly that state of things like it is (evaṃ mañjuśrīḥ bhavet te ’pi tu rāgasaṃprayuktāḥ satvā yādṛśā iyaṃ dharmatā tayaiva yuktāḥ).And the bodhisatvas train themselves in this dharma of attachment and produce the thought of the incomparable perfect awakening (bodhisatvā asmin prayuktadharme śikṣante, anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpādayanti).Why? Mañjuśrī, the vices are not real, but born out of thought-constructions, and they disappear when the thought-constructions are understood as something empty (tat kasya hetor, na mañjuśrīḥ kleśā hi yathābhūtāḥ saṃkalpotpannāḥ, evaṃ saṃkalpaparibodhe nirudhyante yathāriktatvāt).As I understand the meaning of what you say, Mañjuśrī, the vices are without any essential nature and unborn, just like a mass of clouds (yathā mañjuśrīr mayā tvadbhāṣitārtho ’dhigataḥ kleśā hi niḥsvabhāvānutpannā meghasaṃghātasadṛśāḥ);the vices are broken up and dissolved in an instant, just like bubbles (kleśā hi kṣaṇabhagnavilīnā budbudasadṛśāḥ);the vices are not produced, just like wind (kleśā hy atyantānabhinirvṛttā vāyusadṛśāḥ);the vices are beyond all spheres, just like a drawing in open space (kleśā hi sarvaviṣayasamatikrāntā ākāśalekhasadṛśāḥ);the vices are not lasting, just like a drawing in water (kleśā hy acirasthitikā udakalekhasadṛśāḥ);the vices are originated from entering wrong considerations, just like demons and spirits (kleśā hy ayoniśomanasikārapraveśotpannā yakṣabhūtasadṛśāḥ);the vices are originated from wrongly seeing things where there is nothing, just like in a fever (kleśā hy abhūtaviparītadarśanotpannā uṣṇasadṛśāḥ).The vices are originted from thought-constructions, and thus non-existent (kleśā hi saṃkalpotpannā abhūtāḥ);the vices are connected to the inclinations of the ego (kleśā hy ahaṃkārenādhyavasānasaṃbaddhāḥ);the vices are graping for the objects by the greed for possessions principle (kleśā hi mamakārena vastuparigrahāḥ);the vices are adventitious since produced by misunderstandings (kleśā hi mithyotpādenāgantukāḥ);the vices are following along the distingusishing marks since a results of thought-constructions (kleśā hi vikalpotpādena nimittānusāriṇaḥ);the vices are non-inspection since a state of non-reflection on the different spheres (kleśā hi nānādhātvavicāranayenāpratyavekṣā);the vices, being originated in accordance with the thoughts, are the absence of introspection (kleśā hi cittānulomikotpāditā anidhyaptiḥ);the vices, originating from the attachment to self and others, are the absence of faith (kleśā hi parātmābhiniveśotpannā asaṃpratyayāḥ);the vices are grasping for the parts of personality (kleśā hi skandhopādānaḥ); the vices are holding on to the spheres of sense-perception as material things (kleśā hi dhātupiṇḍagrahaḥ);the vices are amassing the fields of sense-perception as material things (kleśā hi dhātupiṇḍagrahaḥ); the vices are making distinctions between concepts and forms (kleśā hi nāmarūpapravicayaḥ);the vices are the absence of understanding superficial considerations (kleśā hy ayoniśomanasikārānadhigamaḥ).
But even though that is the case, Mañjuśrī, the vices are the pillar basis of the awakening (evaṃ mañjuśrīḥ bhavet kleśā api tu bodhikīlāśrayaḥ).Why? Because the awakening is immovable (tat kasya hetor, bodhir acalā), and the vices are the seed of awakening – awakening is really the understanding of the vices (kleśā hi bodhibījaṃ, kleśāvabodha eva bodhiḥ).And the vices are the diamond basis of awakening (kleśās tu bodhivajrāśrayaḥ).Why? Because the awakening, by the principle of being inseparable from the totality of reality, cannot be cut by the vices (tat kasya hetor, dharmadhātvasaṃbhedanayena bodhiḥ kleśair asaṃbhinnā).Mañjuśrī, seeing the vices is awakening, awakening belongs to any area (kleśadarśanaṃ mañjuśrīr bodhiḥ, bodhiḥ sarvaviṣayānugatā).Mañjuśrī, as the awakening is not established anywhere, thus also the vices are not established – they do not stay on as they are broken up and melt away as soon as they have arisen (yathā mañjuśrīr bodhir avyavasthitā tathāpi kleśā avyavasthitā utpannā bhagnavilīnā anavasthitāḥ).Mañjuśrī, the vices have thought as its essential nature (kleśā mañjuśrīś cittasvabhāvāḥ).Why? Mañjuśrī, it is not possible to point out the essential nature of thought by expressions as “this thought is full of desire, full of aversion, full of bewilderment” (tat kasya hetor, na śakyaṃ mañjuśrīś idaṃ cittaṃ raktaṃ vā dviṣṭaṃ vā mūḍhaṃ veti nidarśayituṃ cittasvabhāvaḥ).But, Mañjuśrī, as it is impossible to demonstrate what is thought, it is also not possible to point out the essential nature of the vices by expressions as “the vices are found in certain places and regions” (yathā mañjuśrīr na śakyaṃ cittaṃ nidarśayituṃ tathāpi na śakyaṃ kleśā deśasthā vā pradeśasthā veti nidarśayituṃ kleśasvabhāvaḥ).
A bodhisatva, Mañjuśrī, a great being, to the extent he penetrates the vices, to that extent he does not get tired in bringing to maturity beings behaving according to desire, not those behaving according to aversion, not those behaving according to bewilderment, he does not get tired in bringing to maturity beings behaving according to the three vices in equal combination (bodhisatvo mañjuśrīr mahāsatvo yathā yathā tān kleśān pratividhyate tathā tathā na sa rāgacaritānāṃ satvānāṃ paripācanayā parikhidyate, na dveṣacaritānāṃ, na mohacaritānāṃ, na sabhāgacaritānāṃ satvānāṃ paripācanayā parikhidyate).Thus, Mañjuśrī, I will look upon my own desire in the same way as upon the desire of all those behaving according to desire (evaṃ mañjuśrīr yathātmarāgaṃ tathā sarveṣāṃ rāgacaritānāṃ rāgaṃ darśayiṣyāmi);thus, Mañjuśrī, I will look upon my own aversion in the same way as upon the aversion of all those behaving according to aversion (evaṃ mañjuśrīr yathātmadveṣaṃ tathā sarveṣāṃ dveṣacaritānāṃ dveṣaṃ darśayiṣyāmi);thus, Mañjuśrī, I will look upon my own bewilderment in the same way as upon the bewilderment of all those behaving according to bewilderment (evaṃ mañjuśrīr yathātmamohaṃ tathā sarveṣāṃ mohacaritānāṃ mohaṃ darśayiṣyāmi);thus, Mañjuśrī, I will look upon my own vices in the same way as upon the vices of all those behaving according to vices (evaṃ mañjuśrīr yathātmakleśān tathā sarveṣāṃ kleśacaritānāṃ kleśān darśayiṣyāmi).
Just as, Mañjuśrī, the fire is not scared by all grass and trees; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the fire of saintly insight is not scared by all the grass and trees of vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr nāgnis sarvatṛṇakāṣṭair bhītaḥ, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñāgniḥ sarvakleśatṛṇakāṣṭair bhītaḥ).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the disk of the sun does not stay in the company of darkness; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, saintly insight does not stay in the company of vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr na sūryamaṇḍalaṃ tamo’ndhakāreṇa sārdhaṃ saṃvasati, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñā sarvakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the wind does not cling to trees and mountains; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does not cling to any region of vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr na mārutaḥ vṛkṣaparvataiḥ saktaḥ, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaviṣayaiḥ saktaḥ).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the element of space does not get burnt by all the fire of the world conflagration; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does not get burnt by all the fire of the world conflagration of vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr nākāśadhātuḥ sarvakalpaparidāhena dahyate, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśakalpaparidāhena dahyate).Just as, Mañjuśrī, as space does not stay in the company of dust, mist and clouds; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does not stay in the company of any vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr nākāśaṃ rajomahikāmeghaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati).Just as, Mañjuśrī, as space does not stay in the company of earth; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does not stay in the company of any vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr nākāśaṃ pṛthivyā sārdhaṃ saṃvasati, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati).Just as, Mañjuśrī, as the loadstone does not stay in the company of iron; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does not stay in the company of any vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr nāyaskānto ’yobhiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the mountain Cakravāḍa cannot be shaken by all the winds; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight cannot be shaken by all the vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr na cakravāḍaḥ sarvavāyubhiḥ kampayituṃ śakyate, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaiḥ kampayituṃ śakyate).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the bird goose from the animal world drinks the milk and not the water from a mixture of milk and water; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight takes out the insight and not the vices from a mixture of saintly insight and vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr haṃsa iti tiryagyonigataḥ pakṣī kṣīravārimiśrāt kṣīram eva pibati na vāri, evam eva mañjuśrīr āryaprajñācarito bodhisatva āryaprajñākleśamiśrāt prajñām eva gṛhṇāti na kleśān).Just as, Mañjuśrī, in the northern continent the tree branches will not bow down to women who have sexual relations with relatives; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does not bow down to those living beings whose organs are immature.Thus, Mañjuśrī, I have no fears for the vices (evam mañjuśrīr nāsti me kleśais trāsabhayam). Why? The bodhisatvas, Mañjuśrī, are clad in the armour of fearlessness (tat kasya hetor, bodhisatvā mañjuśrīr abhayasaṃnāhasaṃnaddhāḥ).Just as, Mañjuśrī, one cannot call a hero one that fears the enemy; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, one cannot call a bodhisatva one that fears the vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr yaḥ śatruṇā trasto na sa śūra ity ucyate, evam eva mañjuśrīr yaḥ kleśais trasto na sa bodhisattva ity ucyate).Just as, Mañjuśrī, one cannot call a hero one that is conquered by the enemy; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, one cannot call a bodhisatva one that is conquered by the vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr yaḥ śatruṇā jito na sa śūra ity ucyate, evam eva mañjuśrīr yaḥ kleśais jito na sa bodhisatva ity ucyate).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the jewel called “waterpurifyer” purifies all the dirt in the water when thown into the water without getting sticky and without being sullied by the impurities in the water; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight, even if he is situated among the vices, he purifies all the impurities in the vices without getting sticky and without being sullied by the impurities in the vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr udakaprasādikaṃ nāma maṇiratnaṃ na vāriprakṣiptaṃ snighdaṃ na jalamalopaliptaṃ sarvajalakāluṣyaṃ prasādayati, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ kleśasthito ’pi snigdho na kleśamalopaliptaḥ sarvakleśakāluṣya praśamayati).
Then, after the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī had given this teaching, she again addressed the princely Mañjuśrī:How, Mañjuśrī, does the bodhisatva become free from vices (kathaṃ mañjuśrīr bodhisatvo niṣkleśo bhavati)?Mañjuśrī said: Sister, the bodhisatva who sees the vices in terms of originating and disappearing is not called a bodhisatva without vices (mañjuśrīr uvāca yo bhagini bodhisatvaḥ kleśān utpadyamānān nirudhyamānān paśyati sa na bodhisatvo niṣkleśa ucyate).Sister, if only darkness appears in an oil lamp, it cannot really be called an oil lamp, in the same way, sister, the bodhisatva who sees the vices in terms of originating and disappearing is not called a bodhisatva without all vices (tadyathā bhagini yasmin tailapradīpe tamo’ndhakāraṃ pratibhāsate na sa tailapradīpa ucyate, evam eva bhagini yo bodhisatvaḥ kleśān utpadyamānān nirudhyamānān paśyati sa na bodhisatvo niṣkleśa ucyate). One without vices, sister, is called the one who does not see impurity anywhere, who does not see purity, he is one without vices when he is beyond seeing and non-seeing, beyond thought, mind and consciousness (niṣkleśa iti bhagini yo yatra na saṃkleśaṃ paśyati na vyavadātaṃ paśyati, darśanādarśanacittamanovijñaptyapagato niṣkleśaḥ).Those, sister, who anywhere foster the activity of thoughts, mind and consciousness – even the thought of extinction – they all have vices (ye bhagini yatra cittamanovijñaptipravṛttaya, antamaśo nirvāṇacittaṃ vā, sarve te kliṣṭāḥ).Why? For the one without vices there are neither thought nor activity of thought (tat kasya hetor, na niṣkleśasya cittaṃ vā cittapravṛttir vā).Those who foster thoughts having as the object good and bad, for all of them the formative factors are active (yeṣāṃ kuśalākuśalārambaṇacittapravṛttis teṣāṃ sarveṣāṃ abhisaṃskāraḥ); formative factors are the existence, and existence are the formative factors (yo ’bhisaṃskāraḥ sa saṃsāraḥ, yaḥ saṃsāraḥ so ’bhisaṃskāraḥ); all the formative factors are the existence, they, sister, are the vices (sarvasaṃskārāḥ saṃsāras te bhagini kleśāḥ).The vices, sister, are attachment (kleśa iti bhagini tat saṃyojanam).The attachment of eye and forms is vice (cakṣūrūpasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), as the attachement of ear and sound, nose and smell, tongue and taste, body and tangibles, mind and moments of existence is vice (evaṃ srotraśabdaghrāṇagandhajihvārasakāyaspraṣṭavyasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), the attachment to morality is vice (śīlasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), the attachment to meditation is vice (samādhisaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), the attachment to insight, liberation and the seeing of the knowledge of liberation is vice (prajñāvimokṣavimokṣajñānadarśanasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), the attachment to isolation is vice (pravivekasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ).Absence of vice, sister, is a designation for the absence of activity (niḥkleśa iti bhaginy apracārasyaitad adhivacanam), absence of vice is a designation for the absence of discursive thinking (niḥkleśa iti niḥprapañcasyaitad adhivacanam), absence of vice is a designation for the absence of effort (niḥkleśa iti anābhogasyaitad adhivacanam), absence of vice is a designation for the absence of purpose (niḥkleśa ity apracārasyaitad adhivacanam), the one without calculation and non-calculation, sister, is without vices (gaṇanāgaṇanāviraho bhagini niḥkleśaḥ).
Further, sister, as the Tahāgata says, the one who himself is without vices, but strives to release others from vices, he is to be called without vices (punar aparaṃ bhagini ya ātmani niḥkleśaḥ parān ca kleśapramocanāya prayujyate so niḥkleśa iti tathāgatenoktam),so freeing others from the vices is the bodhisatva’s adoption of vigour (parān kleśāt pramocanaṃ tu bodhisatvasya vīryasamādanam).The girl said: Mañjuśrī, what is the bodhisatva’s adoption of vigour (dārikovāca katamad mañjuśrīr bodhisatvasya vīryasamādanam)?Mañjuśrī said: Being in accordance with reflection on emptiness but still having compassion for beings acting according to viewpoints (mañjuśrīr uvāca śūnyatāpratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi dṛṣṭicariteṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the absence of distinguishing marks but still having compassion for beings acting according to distinguishing marks (ānimittapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi nimittacariteṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the absence of wishful thinking but still having compassion for beings acting according to wishful thinking (apraṇidhānapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi praṇidhānacariteṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the absence of formative factors but still having compassion for beings acting according to formative factors (anabhisaṃskārapratyavekṣānuvartanatâpy abhisaṃskāracariteṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the absence of birth and death but still having compassion for beings having concepts of old age and death (jāticyutipratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi jarāmaraṇasaṃjñeṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the unbornness but still having compassion for beings having concepts of origination and destruction (anutpadapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi utpādavināśasaṃjñeṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the devlopment of a disciple but still giving up the attainment of the fruit of the disciple (śrāvakaniyāmapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi śrāvakaphalaprāptivyāvartanam),being in accordance with reflection on the devlopment of an isolated buddha but still giving up the attainment of the fruit of the isolated buddha (pratyekabuddhaniyāmapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi pratyekabuddhaphalaprāptivyāvartanam),being in accordance with reflection on the development of a bodhisatva but still having compassion with all beings (bodhisatvanyāmapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi sarvasatveṣu ca kāruṇyam),this, sister, the bodhisatva’s adoption of vigour (idaṃ bhagini bodhisatvasya vīryasamādanam).
Just as, sister, it is easy to go into the ocean, but getting hold of the great pearls and return is hard (tadyathā bhagini mahāsāgarapraveśaḥ sukaro mahāratnāny ādāya vyavartanaṃ duṣkaram).In the same way, sister, to reflect on emptiness is easy, but returning from it is difficult for the one without expedient means (evam eva bhagini śūnyatāpratyavekṣā sukaropāyarahitena vyāvartanaṃ duṣkaram);to reflect on absence of distinguishing marks, wishful thinking and formative factors, the absence of birth and origination, the way of development of the disciples and the isolated buddhas is easy, but returning from it is difficult for the one without expedient means (ānimittāpraṇihitānabhisaṃskārājātyanutpādaśrāvakanyāmapratyekabuddhanyāmapratyavekṣā sukaropāyarahitena vyāvartanaṃ duṣkaram).Just as, sister, it is easy to enter a great battle, but getting out without injuries and unhurt is hard. In the same way, sister, to enter the three gates of liberation is easy, but returning is difficult for the one without expedient means (tadyathā bhagini mahāyuddhapraveśaḥ sukaro ’vraṇitānupahatottarṇaṃ duṣkaram, evam eva bhagini trivimokṣamukhapraveśaḥ sukara upāyarahitena vyāvartanaṃ duṣkaram).The girl said: What, Mañjuśrī, are expedient means like?Mañjuśrī said: Expedient means, sister, is not giving up the two opposite sides, that is, the side of existence and the side of extinction (kīdṛśo mañjuśrīr upāya iti, mañjuśrīr uvāca, upāya iti bhagini yad dvipakṣāprahāṇaṃ kiṃ tu saṃsārapakṣo nirvāṇapakṣaś ca).Expedient means, sister, is demonstrating the dual gates (upāya iti bhagini yo mukhadvaysaṃdarśaṇaḥ), that is, the gate of existence and the gate of extinction (saṃsāramukhaṃ nirvāṇamukhaṃ ca), the gate of emptiness and the gate of freedom from viewpoints (śūnyatāmukhaṃ dṛṣṭivimokṣamukhaṃ ca), the gate of absence of distinguishing marks and the gate of freedom from distinguishing marks (ānimittamukhaṃ nimittavimokṣamukhaṃ ca), the gate of absence of no wishful thinking aand the gate of being born according to one’s wish (apraṇidhānamukhaṃ saṃcintyopapattimukhaṃ ca), the gate of absence of things formed and the gate of forming the good (anabhisaṃskāramukhaṃ kuśalābhisaṃskaraṇamukhaṃ ca), the gate of no birth and the gate of demonstrating birth (anutpādamukham utpādasaṃdarśanamukhaṃ ca), the gate of no activity and the gate of parts of the personality, spheres and fields of senseperception (apravṛttimukhaṃ skandhadhātvāyatanamukhaṃ ca), the gate of no origination and destruction and the gate of birth and activity (anutpādānirodhamukhaṃ utpādapravṛttimukhaṃ ca), the gate of isolation and the gate of maturing beings (vivekamukhaṃ satvaparipācanāmukhaṃ ca), the gate of total reality and the gate of caring for every single thing (dharmadhātumukhaṃ sarvadharmapratirakṣaṇamukhaṃ ca), the gate of the way of disciplines and the gate of the determination of the bodhisatva (śrāvakayānamukhaṃ bodhisatvādhyāśayamukhaṃ ca), the gate of isolated awakening and the gate of never forgetting the qualities of the Buddha (pratyekabodhimukhaṃ buddhadharmāsaṃpramoṣamukhaṃ ca).Sister, the bodhisatva demonstrating the dual gates but not getting attached to any gates is called able in expedient means (yo bhagini bodhisatvo mukhadvayam upadarśayann api sarvamukheṣv asaktaḥ sa upāyakuśala ucyate).In the same way with the gate of desire and the gate of absence of desire (evam eva rāgamukhaṃ vigatarāgamukhaṃ ca), the gate of aversion and the gate of absence of aversion (dveṣamukhaṃ vigatadveṣamukhaṃ ca), the gate of bewilderment and the gate of absence of bewilderment (mohamukhaṃ vigatamohamukhaṃ ca), the gate of vices and the gate of absence of vices (kleśamukhaṃ vigatakleśamukhaṃ ca), the gate of all movement and the gate of absence of movement (sarvagatimukham agatimukhaṃ ca), this, sister is the bodhisatvas ability in expedient means (idaṃ bhagini bodhisatvasyopāyākauśalyam).The gate of the behaviour of the ordinary naive beings and the gate of the behaviour of the one to be trained, the one without need of further training, the disciple, the isolated buddhas as well as that of the bodhisatva, the knowledge of these two gates is the ability in expedient means of the bodhisatva (yad bālapṛthagjanacaryāmukhaṃ śaikṣāśaikṣaśrāvakapratyekabuddhabodhisatvacaryāmukhaṃ ca yad taddvayajñānam idam bodhisatvasyopāyakauśalyam ucyate).
At that time the Lord was walking with his attendant the venerable monk Ānanda in the mountain forest (girikuñja) on the slopes of the Vulture Peak (gṛdhrakūṭaparvatatala), and then sat down. Having sat down he addressed the princely Mañjuśrī:“Mañjuśrī, the way you taught the bodhisatva’s assumption of vigour (vīryasamādāna) and ability in expedient means (upāyakauśalya), that is just the way they are, it is very good, very good!”By that word “Very good” the whole system of threefold thousand great thousand world spheres was filled with the sound, and by that word “Very good” the whole system of threefold thousand great thousand sixfold world spheres were moved, and gods, snakegods, demons, heavenly musicians, giants, celestial birds, man-horses, great snakes, men and not men, the king of the gods, the creator and many protectors of the world were incited by that word “Very good” and went to the the place where the Lord stayed, greeted him by bowing the head to the feet of the Lord and sat down at one side.Having sat down, the gods, snakegods, demons, heavenly musicians, giants, celestial birds, man-horses, great snakes, men and not men, the king of the gods, the creator and many protectors of the world said to the Lord: “To whom did the Lord express the word “Very good”, by which the whole system of threefold thousand great thousand world spheres was filled with the sound?” The Lord said: “Sons of gods, it was to the princely Mañjuśrī.”The sons of gods said: “Lord, where does the princely Mañjuśrī stay now?” The Lord said: “Sons of gods, the princely Mañjuśrī stays at the eastern gate of the great city Rājagṛha engaged in religious conversation with the daughter of a courtesan called Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī, so the sons of gods who wishes to listen to the religion should go there.”Then all those gods, snakegods, demons, heavenly musicians, giants, celestial birds, man-horses, great snakes, men and not men, the king of the gods, the creator and many protectors of the world assembled and went to where the princely Mañjuśrī stayed, and having manifested themselves in gross bodies and made it rain with flowers, and by that rain of flowers bunches of flowers were spread all over the neighbourhood (parisamanta) of Rājagṛha.There the gods could see the men and men could see the gods, but they did not expostulate with each other. And many hundred thousand beings from the great city of Rājagṛha, having been incited by those flowers, having been incited by those visible bodies of the gods (devaudārikakāya), went to where the princely Mañjuśrī stayed.The king Ajātaśatru – surrounded by his retinue of women, with his armed forces of four classes (caturaṅgabala), with great royal richness and great royal might (mahārājānubhava) – also went to where the princely Mañjuśrī stayed, and the retinue, the king, the ministers, the sons of the ministers, the traders, the sons of the householders saw that daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī freed from the manifestation of the vice desire (rāgakleśaparyutthāna), her senses and behaviour were calm (praśāntendriyeryāpatha), and her senses were not disturbed (atandritendriya), full of shame, adorned with beauty (śrīsamalaṃkṛtā). And having seen her, the mental construction of desire (rāgavikalpa) did not afterwards arise in them.
Then the princely Mañjuśrī, having seen that great crowd of people (mahājanakāya), said to the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī: “My child (dārike), even though seeing this great crowd of people you are not any more filled with desire, so where have you disposed of your vices (kleśa)?”The girl said: “The vices, Mañjuśrī, of all beings are placed within knowledge and liberation, placed within the totality of moments of existence (āha sarvasatvānāṃ kleśā jñānavimokṣasthitā dharmadhātusthitā), and I have understood them thus as without origination, without destruction without change (te caivaṃ mayānutpannāniruddhāvikṛtā avabuddhāḥ), this essential nature of the vices is what I have understood (yaḥ kleśasvabhāvaḥ sa tu mayāvabuddhaḥ).”Mañjuśrī said: “My child, what is the essential nature of vices (mañjuśrīr uvāca kleśasvabhāvo dārike katamaḥ)?”The girl said: “The essential nature beyond construction and thought-construction, Mañjuśrī, is the essential nature of the vices (akalpāvikalpasvabhāvo mañjuśrīḥ kleśasvabhāvaḥ); the fundamentally unborn essential nature is the essential nature of the vices (yoniśo’nutpannasvabhāvaḥ kleśasvabhāvaḥ); the vices are adventitious, they do not stay on with the understanding of emptiness (āgantukāḥ kleśā na śūnyatādhigamena sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti); they do not stay on with knowledge of the absence of distinguishing marks and the absence of wishful thinking (nānimittāpraṇdhānajñānena sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti); they do not stay with the originally pure light (na prakṛtiprabhāsvareṇa sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti).Just like, Mañjuśrī, a man is killed in a minute by a venomous (viṣogra) snake (āśīviṣa), but if a man eats the drug called Agada, which neutralizes all poison (sarvaviṣaghna) and passifies all poison (sarvaviṣapraśamana), then, as soon as the drug is administered, the poison of the venomous snake (āśīviṣaviṣa) is made to nought, and boys and girls can play with it. Playing with the snake they adopt it (kroḍīkṛ-) and binds it with ornaments (pārśvasūtraka), but even though they adorn it it does not hurt (na dahati) or bite (na bhakṣayati) or inflict harm upon anybody (na duḥkhayati).In the same way, Mañjuśrī, I had not heard of the discipline of religion before and was burnt by the vices brought about by superficial mental activity and misunderstandings (evam eva mañjuśrīr aham aśrutapūrvadharmavinayāyoniśomanasikāraviparītopasthitaiḥ kleśaiḥ paridagdhā), attached to my own body by desire (rāgeṇa svakāyasaktā), attached to my beauty (svarūpābhiniviṣṭā), and I did not reflect on (pratyavekṣ-) the fact that beauty (rūpa) is just like foam (phenopama); I did not understand that the body (kāya) has the nature of an illusion (māyopama), I did not understand that playing with pleasures (ratikrīḍā) is like a dream (svapnopamā), I did not understand that the taste of the pleasure of desire (kāmaratyāsvāda) is like a drop of honey (madhu), I did not understand that the life-principle (jīvitendriya) is like dew-drops (avaśyāyabindhūpama), I did not understand that all composite things (saṃskāra) are impermanent (anitya), I did not understand that the body is impure (aśubha), I did not understand that all composite things (saṃskāra) are intense suffering (atyantaduḥkhita), and I did not reflect on (pratyavekṣ-) the fact that all moments of existence are without self-substance (anātma). I was thus myself obscured by darkness and also obscured others (ahaṃ ca tamo’ndhakārāvṛtā parāñ cāndhīcakāra), I was bound myself and bound others (ahaṃ ca baddhā parāñ ca babandha).When I, Mañjuśrī, heard your speech on religion, and having heard it got faith in it, having got faith in it I was freed (yadā mañjuśrīr ahaṃ tvaddharmakathāṃ śrutā śrutvā cādhimuktādhimucya ca vimuktā), so I will not, neither in the present, nor in the future, look upon anyone with desirous eyes (tasmān nāhaṃ kaṃcid sāmpratam āyatyāṃ vā raktacakṣuṣā drakṣyāmi).And why? Mañjuśrī, light does not coexist with darkness (tat kasya hetoḥ, na mañjuśrīr ālokas tamobhiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati), and, in the same way, Mañjuśrī, no one without vices is attached to the vices (evam eva mañjuśrīr na kaścid vigatarāgaḥ kleśai raktaḥ).
Then the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī said to the princely Mañjuśrī:Please Mañjuśrī, since these great congregations of gods and men are assembled here, be eloquent in your religious speech so that these gods and these men produce the thought of the absolute incomparable awakening out of compassion for the living beings, that after having understood the essential nature of the vices (he mañjuśrīr asya devaparṣado mānuṣyaparṣadaś ca saṃnipatitatvād evaṃ dharmakathāyai pratibhātu te yena ete devā mānuṣyāś ca kleśasvabhāvam avabudhya satveṣu kāruṇyenānuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpādayiṣyanti).Mañjuśrī said: But sister, the essential nature of the vices is very difficult to reach (duradhimocya bhagini kleśasvabhāvaḥ). And why? Because the essential nature of the vices is awakening (tat kasya hetoḥ, kleśasavbhāvo bhagini bodhiḥ).
1) Just like, sister, a fire not ignited does not have the nature of burning, in the same way, sister, the vice which is not imagined does not have the nature of existence (tadyathā bhagini nāgnir ajāto dāhanātmakaḥ, evam eva bhagini na kleśo ’parikalpitaḥ saṃsārātmakaḥ).2) Just like, sister, a fire which is ignited has the nature of burning, in the same way, sister, the vice which is imagined has the nature of existence (tadyathā bhaginy agnir jāto dāhanātmakaḥ, evam eva bhagini kleśaḥ parikalpitaḥ saṃsārātmakaḥ).3) Just like, sister, if the fire has a cause it burns, in the same way, sister, if the vices have the cause of the manifestation of viewpoints it burns in the three spheres of existence (tadyathā bhagini hetuko ’gnir jvalati, evam eva bhagini dṛṣṭiparyutthānahetukāḥ kleśās traidhātuke jvalati).4) Just like, sister, if the fire has no cause it does not burn, in the same way, sister, if the vices does not have the cause of the manifestation of viewpoints it does not burn in the three spheres of existence (tadyathā bhagini nāhetuko ’gnir jvalati, evam eva bhagini na dṛṣṭiparyutthānāhetukāḥ kleśās traidhātuke jvalati).5) Just like, sister, there is no increase or decrease in the thousand year fire, in the same way, sister, there is no increase or decrease in the vices committed during a hundred thousand world-ages (tadyathā bhagini na varṣasaharsāgner upacayāpacayaḥ, evam eva bhagini na kalpaśatasahasracaritakleśānām upacayāpacayaḥ).6) Just like, sister, an extinguished fire cannot be called a fire, in the same way, sister, vices at peace cannot be called vices (tadyathā bhagini na praśāntāgnir agniḥ prajñapyate, evam eva bhagini na praśāntakleśaḥ kleśaḥ prajñapyate).7) Just like, sister, though fire burns in open space it cannot burn the space, in the same way, sister, though the adventitious vices arise in the originally luminous, they are not able to pollute the originally luminous (tadyathā bhagini yatra ākāśe agnir jvalati na so ’gnir ākāśaṃ dagdhuṃ śakyate, evam eva bhagini yatra prakṛtiprabhāsvara āgantukakleśā utpannā api na te kleśās tat prakṛtiprabhāsvaraṃ saṃkleśayituṃ śakyante).
1) But even though that is the case, sister, how should the body of form be regarded (evam api bhagini kathaṃ rūpakāyo draṣṭavyaḥ)? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, just like the reflection of the moon in a small lake (āha yathā mañjuśrīr hradodakāntara udakacandraḥ).2) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl, should the parts of personality be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, the manifestation of the Real Being (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike skandhā draṣṭavyāḥ, āha yathā mañjuśrīs tathāgatasya nirmāṇaḥ).3) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl, should the spheres of sense-perception be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, the three spheres of existence when consumed by the fire of the world-age (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike dhātavo draṣṭavyāḥ, āha yathā mañjuśrīḥ kalpāgniparidagdhaṃ traidhātukam).4) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl, should the fields of sense-perception be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, an action to be formed as unformed (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārika āyatanāni draṣṭavyāni, āha yathā mañjuśrī anabhisaṃskṛtam abhisaṃskartavyaṃ karma ).5) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl, should this congregation be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, the empty space above us (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārika iyaṃ parṣad draṣṭavyā, āha yathā mañjuśrīr uparivihāyo’ntarikṣam).6) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl, should you be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, a meeting between my mother and father (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike tvaṃ draṣṭavyā, āha yathā mañjuśrīr mātāpitṛsamāgamanam).7) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl, should I be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, the seeing of a form of a blind (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike ’haṃ draṣṭavyāḥ, āha yathā mañjuśrīr anadhakasya rūpadarśanam).8) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, are these teachings heard by you? The girl said: They are heard, Mañjuśrī, as the aural information of a magically created [man] (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārika ime dharmāḥ śrutāḥ, āha yathā mañjuśrīr māyānirmitasya śrotravijñaptyā śrutāḥ).9) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, do you wish to reach the incomparable complete awakening? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, since I am the awakening myself I do not need to wish for it once more (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvaṃ dārike ’nuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhim icchasi, dārikovācāham eva mañjuśrīr bodhir na punar icchāmi).10) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you practiced the perfection of giving? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have practiced it by completely giving away my vices (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārike dānāpāramitā caritā, āha mayā mañjuśrīḥ sarvakleśātyantaparityāgena caritā).11) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you fulfilled the perfection of morality? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have fulfilled it in the way of filling up empty space (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārike śīlapāramitā paripūritā, āhākāśaparipūranayā mañjuśrīḥ paripūritā).12) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you cultivated the perfection of tolerance? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have cultivated it by means of the unbornness and absence of all beings (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārike kṣāntipāramitā bhāvitā, āha sarvasatvānutpādābhāvena mañjuśrīr bhāvitā).13) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you undertaken the perfection of vigour? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have undertaken it by the principle that all moments of existence are beyound reach (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārike vīryapāramitārabdhā, āha sarvadharmāprāptinayena mañjuśrīr ārabdhā).14) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, are you established in the perfection of meditation? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I am established by the principle that total reality is not established (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārike dhyānapāramitāvasthitā, āha dharmadhātvanavasthānayena mañjuśrīr aham avasthitā).15) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you fulfilled the perfection of insight? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have fulfilled it in the way that there is no rest (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārike prajñāpāramitā paripūritā, dārikovācānadhikaṃ mañjuśrīḥ paripūritā).16) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you cultivated the friendliness? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have cultivated it by the principle that all beings are non-existent (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārike maitrī bhāvitā, āha sarvasatvābhāvanayena mañjuśrīr bhāvitā).17) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, from where is great compassion to be sought by the bodhisatva? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, great compassion is to be sought by the bodhisatva from the vices of all beings. Why? If the vices of all beings did not exist, the bodhisatva would not produce the thought of awakening (mañjuśrīr uvāca mahākaruṇā dārike yato bodhisatvena paryeṣṭavyā, āha mahākaruṇā mañjuśrīr bodhisatvena sarvasatvānāṃ kleśebhyaḥ paryeṣṭavyā. tat kasya hetoḥ. sarvasatvānāṃ kleśā yadi na bhaveyur bodhisatvo ’nuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau na cittam utpādayet).18) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, from where is joy to be sought by the bodhisatva? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, joy is to be sought by the bodhisatva from the thought of awakening characterized by great determination (mañjuśrīr uvāca muditā dārike yato bodhisatvena paryeṣṭavyā, āha muditā mañjuśrīr bodhisatvenādhyāśayasahagatād bodhicittāt paryeṣṭavyā).19) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, what does the equanimity of the bodhisatva effect? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, the equanimity of the bodhisatva fulfils true speech towards all beings and demonstrates the absence of aversion towards any moments of existence (mañjuśrīr uvāca bodhisatvasyopekṣā dārika kiṃ karoti, āha bodhisatvasyopekṣā mañjuśrīḥ sarvasatveṣv avisaṃvādanatāṃ paripūrayati sarvadharmeṣv aprativirodhatāṃ copadarśayati).20) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, what are the ones filled with aversion? The girl said: Those, Mañjuśrī, who have entered awakening trying to get rid of the vices which really are inexistent (mañjuśrīr uvāca katame dārike prativiruddhā iti, āha ye ’bhūtakleśaprahāṇāya bodhipraviṣṭāḥ).21) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, to whom are they averse? The girl said: To all with other views (mañjuśrīr uvāca te dārike kena prativiruddhā, āha sarvaparapravādibhiḥ).22) Mañjuśrī said: But, girl, who are the ones with other views? The girl said: Those who speak to others with conceited thoughts of tolerance (mañjuśrīr uvāca katame dārike parapravādinaḥ, āha ye kṣāntimanyanayā parān pravadanti).23) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, where does tolerance come from? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, it comes from being hurt by all beings. Why? If one is not hurt there is no tolerance. One who unperturbed does not hurt anyone, even though hurt by all beings, he has cultivated tolerance (mañjuśrīr uvāca kasmād dārike kṣāntir ity āgatā, āha sarvasatvaviheṭhanāyā mañjuśrīr āgatā. tat kasya hetoḥ. nāviheṭhanāyāṃ kṣāntiḥ kācid bhavet. yo mañjuśrīḥ sarvasatvaviheṭhanāyām aprakupito na viheṭayati sa kṣāntibhāvitaḥ).24) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, what is aversion like? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, because it destroys the roots of good collected for a hundred world ages, that is why it is called aversion (mañjuśrīr uvāca katamo dārike pratigha iti, āha yena mañjuśrīḥ kalpaśatopacitaṃ kuśalamūlaṃ pratihanti tenocyate pratigha iti).125) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, what is absence of aversion ? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, the one without negative thoughts does not harm any field of sense perception, he is [also] to be known as tolerant (mañjuśrīr uvāca katamo dārike ’pratigha iti, āha yo mañjuśrīr apratihatacitto na sarvaviṣayān pratihanti sa kṣānta iti veditavyaḥ).26) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how does the bodhisatva become victorious in the battle? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, he discerns all moments of existence but does not apprehend them (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike bodhisatvo vijitasaṃgrāmo bhavati, āha yo mañjuśrīr vicīya sarvadharmān nopalabhate).227) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how does a bodhisatva become a killer of the fiend, the Evil One? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, he is one who does not get sullied even though he is one who subdues the Evil One (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike mārapratyarthikaghātako bhavati, āha yo mañjuśrīr na māradamako ’pi kliśyate). Why? Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva shows the parts of his personality, but he does not abide with the vices in the parts of personality (tat kasya hetoḥ, na bodhisatvo mañjuśrīḥ skandhān darśayann api skandhakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati); and, Mañjuśrī, even though the bodhisatva demonstrates vices, he is essentially and by his nature not attached to them (bodhisatvo mañjuśrīḥ kleśān darśayann api svabhāvadharmatayāsaktaḥ); he demonstrates old age and death to mature living beings, but he understands that all moments of existence are beyond death and movement (satvaparipācanāya jarāmaraṇaṃ darśayann api sarvadharmān acyutanirgamanān prabodhati); and even though, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva shows [these qualities] as a son of a god, he is without all envy and conceit (bodhisatvo mañjuśrīr devaputro darśayann api sarverṣyāmanyanāprahīṇaḥ).28) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how does the bodhisatva bring living beings to maturity? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva brings beings to maturity by cultivating insight and expedient means (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike bodhisatvaḥ sattvān paripācayati, āha bodhisatvo mañjuśrīḥ prajñopāyaparibhāvanayā satvān paripācayati).29) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how does the bodhisatva stay in the nearness of all beings? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, by cultivating his own thoughts and knowledge does he stay in the nearness of all beings (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike bodhisatvaḥ sarvasatvāntike tiṣṭhati, āha svacittajñānaparibhāvito mañjuśrīr bodhisattvaḥ sarvasatvāntike tiṣṭhati).30) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, is there in this congregation a wish to listen to your teachings? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, in the one who has entered into the concept of self and others there is no wish to listen, in the one who has entered into the consciousness of information derived from hearing there is no wish to listen (mañjuśrīr uvāca iyaṃ dārike parṣat tvaddharmaṃ śuśrūṣamāṇā, āha yasya mañjuśrīḥ parātmasaṃjñāpraveśaḥ so ’śruśrūṣamāṇo yasya śrotravijñaptivijñānapraveśaś cāśruśrūṣamāṇaḥ).31) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, so what is the wish to listen to religion? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, when one believes in one’s own body as in a man appearing in a dream, when one believes in the teacher of religion as in a man created through magical deception, when one believes in that religious teaching as in an echo, when there is no duality of belief and liberation, that much is the wish to listen (mañjuśrīr uvāca katamā dārike dharmasya śuśrūṣaṇatā, āha yadā mañjuśrīḥ svakāye yathāsvapnapuruṣādhimuktir dharmadeśake yathāmāyāpuruṣādhimuktir tasyāṃ dharmadeśanāyāṃ yathāpratiśrutkādhimuktir adhimuktivimuktyor advaidhīkāras tāvatī śuśrūṣaṇatā).32) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how then should the religious teaching be listened to? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, the religious teaching should be listened to so that one progresses in the reliance on the religious teaching (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike dharmaḥ śrotavyaḥ, āha dharmapratisaraṇe pratipattyā dharmaḥ śrotavyaḥ).Then, when the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī taught religion in that way by means of the powerful precence of the princely Mañjuśrī and the insight resulting from the roots of good which she had collected, twelve thousand beings in that congregation produce the thought of the incomparable complete awakening, five hundred gods and men who had collected roots of good as followers of the bodhisatva’s way attained the tolerance that all things are unborn, and thirty two thousand beings attaind the impeccable pure sight into the moments of existence (atha mañjuśriyaḥ kumārabhūtasyādhiṣṭhānena svakuśalamūlopacayaprajñayā suvarṇottaraprabhāśriyā gaṇikāduhitayā tathā tathā dharma upadiśyamāne, tasyāṃ parṣadi dvādaśaśataprāṇinām anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni, pañcaśatadevamānuṣyāṇāṃ bodhisatvayānikānām pūrvakuśalamūlopacitānām anutpattikadharmakṣāntir upalabdhā, dvātriṃśatyāḥ prāṇisahasrasya virajo vigatamalaṃ dharmacakṣur viśuddham).The girl attained, by the joy and rapture resulting from hearing about religion, the kind of tolerance which is in correspondence with the moments of existence (tasyā dārikayā dharmaśravaṇasya prītyā prāmodyena dharmeṣv ānulomikī kṣāntir upalabdhā). Having attained it she fell down before the feet of the princely Mañjuśrī, asking him for the ascetic life: “Out of compassion, Mañjuśrī, allow me to enter the ascetic life, and release me from this body being made up of the superficial, which is not noble and destroys the noble religion (sā kṣāntim upalabhya mañjuśriyaḥ kumārabhūtasya pādayor nipatya, anukampām upādāya mañjuśrīḥ pravrājahi mām, mocaya mām asmād ayoniśa’utpāditād anāryād āryadharmadūṣakāt kāyād iti pravrajyām adhyaiṣata).
1) Mañjuśri said: It is like this, sister, shaving the hair on the head is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (mañjuśrīr uvāca tadyathā bhagini na tac chiraso muṇḍanaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Why? Girl, the effort to eliminate the vices of all beings is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (tat kasya hetoḥ, yo dārike sarvasatvakleśopacchedāyodyogaḥ sā bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).2) Girl, wearing the yellow robe is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (yad dārike kāṣāyadhāraṇaṃ na sā bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather girl, to adopt the training and rules of morality oneself while instigating beings with bad morality to adopt the vows and practice of morality is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (yad dārika ātmana eva śikṣāśīlasamādānaṃ duḥśīleṣu satveṣu ca śīlasaṃvaravratasamādāpanaṃ sā bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).3) Girl, practicing oneself in isolation is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (yo dārika ātmana eva vivekavihāro na sā bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather girl, establishing in knowledge of isolation the beings dispersed in the five destinies of existence is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (yā dārike pañcagatau saṃsāre vidhāvatāṃ vivekajñāne pratiṣṭhāpanā sā bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).4) The qualities of colour and beaty, of behaviour and appearance is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (na varṇarūpaliṅgeryāpathasaṃsthānaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather, producing thoughts of friendliness and compassion is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (parasatveṣu parapudgaleṣu maitrīkaruṇācittotpādo bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).5) Planting one’s own roots of good is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (na svakuśalamūlāvaropaṇaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather, planting the roots of good of all beings is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (sarvasatvakuśalamūlāvaropaṇaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).6) Honouring the determination to reach one’s own complete extinction is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (nātmapariniravāṇādhyāśayagauravaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather, honouring the determination that others should reach complete extinction is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (parasatvaparinirvāṇādhyāśayagauravaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).7) Appeasing one’s own vices is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (nātmakleśaśamanaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather, appeasing the vices of others is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (sarvasatvakleśaśamanaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).8) Protecting one’s own mind is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (na svacittānurakṣaṇaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather, protecting the minds of all beings is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (sarvasatvacittānurakṣaṇaṃ bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).9) Striving for one’s own freedom is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (nātmamokṣodyogo bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather, striving for the freedom of all beings is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (sarvasatvamokṣodyogo bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).11) Girl, disgust for existence is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (na dārike saṃsāranirvedo bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather, the joy of freeing all beings from existence is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (sarvasatvānāṃ saṃsārottāraṇaratir bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).12) Girl, the pleasure of extinction is not embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (na dārike nirvāṇābhiratir bodhisatvasya pravrajyā). Rather, completing all the qualities of the Awakened is embracing the ascetic life as pertaining to the bodhisatva (sarvabuddhadharmaparipūrir bodhisatvasya pravrajyā).
1) Girl, embracing the ascetic life is an expression for having great compassion for all beings (pravrajyeti dārike parasatveṣu mahākaruṇāyā etad adhivacanam).2) Girl, embracing the ascetic life is an expression for not seeing others’ faults (pravrajyeti dārike paraskhaliteṣv adoṣadarśanasyaitad adhivacanam).3) Girl, embracing the ascetic life is an expression for not being jalous of others’ gain (pravrajyeti dārike paralābheṣv anīrṣyāyā etad adhivacanam).4) Girl, embracing the ascetic life is an expression for harming neither oneself nor others (pravrajyeti dārike parātmopaghātāyā etad adhivacanam).5) Girl, embracing the ascetic life is an expression for not blaming others (pravrajyeti dārike pareṣām akuṃsanatāyā etad adhivacanam).6) Girl, embracing the ascetic life is an expression for serving other (pravrajyeti dārike pareṣāṃ sevanāyā etad adhivacanam).7) Girl, embracing the ascetic life is an expression for not encouraging others’ sins (pravrajyeti dārike pareṣām āpattiṣv acodanatāyā etad adhivacanam).8) Girl, embracing the ascetic life is an expression for bringing them out of all sins (pravrajyeti dārike sarvadoṣoddharaṇasyaitad adhivacanam).
Girl, the embracing of the ascetic life of the bodhisatva is dependent on other things, but the bodhisatva is not dependent on other things (parādhīnā dārike bodhisatvasya pravrajyā bodhisatvas tv aparādhīnaḥ).The girl said: How, Mañjuśrī, is the bodhisatva’s embracing of the ascetic life dependent on other things (dārikovāca kathaṃ mañjuśrīḥ parādhīnā bodhisatvasya pravrajyā)?Mañjuśrī said: Girl, embracing the ascetic life is dependent on morality, in bad morality there is no embracing of the ascetic life (āha pravrajyā dārike śīlādhīnā na tu dauḥśīlye pravrajyā kācana).Girl, embracing the ascetic life is dependent on concentration, in the loss of awarness there is no embracing of the ascetic life (pravrajyā dārike samādhyadhīnā na tu muṣitasmṛtyāṃ pravrajyā kācana).Girl, embracing the ascetic life is dependent on insight, in bad insight there is no embracing of the ascetic life (pravrajyā dārike prajñādhīnā na tu duṣprajñāyāṃ pravrajyā kācana).Girl, embracing the ascetic life is dependent on freedom, in the absence of free thinking there is no embracing of the ascetic life (pravrajyā dārike vimokṣādhīnā na tv avimuktacitte pravrajyā kācana).Girl, embracing the ascetic life is dependent on seeing the insight into freedom, in the absence of seeing the insight into freedom there is no embracing of the ascetic life (pravrajyā dārike vimuktijñānadarśanādhīnā na tv avimuktijñānadarśana pravrajyā kācana).The girl said: How, Mañjuśrī, does the embracing of the homless life of the bodhisatva become independent (dārkovāca kathaṃ mañjuśrīr bodhisatvasya pravrajyāparādhīnā bhavati)?Mañjuśrī said: Girl, the bodhisatva is independent since not conditioned by any other (āha bodhisatvo dārike ’parapratyayatvād aparādhīnaḥ).By his own comprehension and knowledge, whatever he knows, he knows himself, whatever he says he says himself, thus he is independent because absence of compliance (svājñājñānena yat kiṃcit so jānāti tad ātmā jānāti yat kiṃcid bhāṣate tad ātmā bhāṣata ity aparādhīno ’parānurodhatvāt).
As the princely Mañjuśrī preached this exposition of religion consisting in this chapter on embracing the ascetic life, five hundred bodhisatvas took the clothes and ornaments off their bodies because it was so well formulated, and they said: The embracing of the ascetic life of the bodhisatvas as formulated by you was really well formulated, we also wish to attain that embracing of the ascetic life (asmin pravrjyāparivarte dharmaparyāye mañjuśriyā kumārabhūtena bhāṣyamāṇe subhāṣitatvāt pañcabodhisatvaśatāni svakāt svakāt sarvacīvarālaṃkārān kāyād apadhāya mañjuśriye kumārabhūtāya dattvedam avocan, tvadbhāṣitā mañjuśrīr bodhisatvānāṃ pravrajyā subhāṣitā, vayam apīmāṃ pravrjyāṃ pratipatsyāmahe).
Then the princely Mañjuśrī said to the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī: Girl, get on to the cart and, out of compassion, bring the son of a banker Bhayadatta to maturation, by this you will embrace the ascetic life and be ordained (atha mañjuśrīḥ kumārabhūtaḥ suvarṇottaraprabhāśriyaṃ gaṇikāduhitāram idam avocat, tvaṃ dārike ’smin ratha āruḍhā śreṣṭhiputraṃ bhayadattam anukampām ādāya paripācaya, tenaiva tvaṃ pravrājitopasaṃpannā bhaviṣyasi).Then the great crowd of people thought: How can it be right that one without desire can stay in the company of one who is not without desire (atha tasya mahato janakāyasyaivam abhavad vītarāgāvitarāgayoḥ sārdhasaṃvāsaḥ kathaṃ yujyata iti)?The girl knew the reflections of the great crowd of people, and she said (atha sā dārikā tasya mahato janakāyasya cetaḥparivitarkaṃ cetasājñāya taṃ mahāntaṃ janakāyam idam avocat):Even though, friends, the bodhisatva without desires stays in the company of beings full of desire, he is without blemish, he educates the beings full of desires (vītarāgo mārṣā bodhisatvaḥ sarāgaiḥ satvaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasann apy anavadyaḥ sarāgān satvān vinayati);even though, friends, the bodhisatva without aversion stays in the company of beings full of aversion, he is without blemish, he educates the beings full of aversion (vītadoṣo mārṣā bodhisatvaḥ sadoṣaiḥ satvaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasann apy anavadyaḥ sadoṣān satvān vinayati);even though, friends, the bodhisatva without bewilderment stays in the company of beings full of bewilderment, he is without blemish, he educates the beings full of bewilderment (vītamoho mārṣā bodhisatvaḥ samohaiḥ satvaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasann apy anavadyaḥ samohān satvān vinayati);even though, friends, the bodhisatva without vices stays in the company of beings full of vices, he is without blemish, he educates the beings full of vices (niṣkleśo mārṣā bodhisatvaḥ sakleśaiḥ satvaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasann apy anavadyaḥ sakleśān satvān vinayati).Just like, friends, a mother is not desirous of his son, just in the same way, friends, is the bodhisatva not desirous of any living beings (tadyathā mārṣā na mātā putreṇa sārdhaṃ saṃvasaty api raktā, evam eva mārṣā na bodhisatvaḥ sarvasatvaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasann api raktaḥ);just like, friends, a man closed up in prison does not act according to habits of desire, just so friends, the bodhisatva is not attached to concepts in the threefold world which is like a pit in a prison (tadyathā mārṣā na bandhanagaṭṭito puruṣo rāgasamudācāraṃ carati, evam eva mārṣā na traidhātuke bandhanakhadopame saṃjñābhiḥ saktaḥ).
Then the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī went down onto the dharma-stair where one descends from the cart, stepping down and trodding upon the earth. Freed from the obscuration of ignorance (avidyāndhakāra) she had fully realized the vision of fear regarding the vices resulting from the imperfections of existence (bhāvadoṣakleśabhayadarśana), and having bowed her head to the feet of the princely Mañjuśrī and circumambulated him three times, she expressed herself by means of verses beside the stairs of the cart:
1) Being essentially pure (svabhāvaśuddhā) I am not impassioned (rāgāraktā), not affected by aversion (dveṣādviṣṭā) because of constant friendliness (nityamaitricitta), not bewildered by delusion (mohāsaṃmūḍha) because of the light of insight (prajñāvabhāsa) I will mount this cart.2) That by means of which I was overpowered before, when, attached to riches(dhanyaraktā), I went to the park, riding a car with a banker’s son (śreṣṭhiputra) – that thought-construction of passion (rāgavikalpa), where is it gone?3) Just like when thick clouds cover the earth, and the rays of sun does not shine, does not burn (sūryaraśmayo na bhāṣante na tapanti, nevertheless, those rays do not go anywhere, they only cease since they cannot shine due to the covering of the clouds.4) Just so are all fools (bāla), obscured by the vices. Even though they have not developed any intelligence (mati) regarding the light of insight (prajñāvabhāsa), even though they remain outside any area of insight, still, with the thorough understanding of the vices (kleśaparijñā), insight shines forth.5) Vices come (kleśa) comes (āgata) from nowhere, they do not depart (gata) to any place (viṣayapradeśabhāga), vices arise from the superficial (ayoniśas), they do not arise from the fundamental (yoniśas).6) There is no giving away and no grasping, no arising and no destruction, there is no giving to others or taking back, and because of the homogeneousness of all moments of existence (dharmasamatā) I am also pure (viśuddhā).7) When a lamp of sesame oil (tailapradīpa) appears in the darkness, there is no going of the darkness into different directions, when darkness is dispelled by insight (prajñā) there is no cessation of vices and also no origination.8) Just like a doctor who is curing a patient does not destroy the elements of the [patient’s] body (dhātu), but pacifies the adventitious (āgantuka) disease, and then other diseases do not arise.9) In the same way the best of physicians Mañjughoṣa, knowing the appropriate methods (yuktanayajña), pacifies (upaśamayati) the vices of beings by the different practices, but he does not make the moments of existence disappear.10) These parts of the personality (skandha), spheres (dhātu) and fields of sense perception (āyatana) do not change at all (atyantanirvikāra). Earlier they were possessed by the poison of sin (doṣaviṣa), and still they are unchanged, but rendered free of poison.
Then the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī, having spoken these verses again bowed her head to the feet of the princely Mañjuśrī, and, having again circumambulated the princely Mañjuśrī, she ascended on to the cart with the son of a banker Bhayadatta, and went with all those riches to the park.And the princely Mañjuśrī taught the whole of that assembly by means of religious conversation, he made them take it to their hearts, made them rejoice and made them happy (mañjuśrīḥ kumārabhūto ’pi sarvāvatīṃ parṣadaṃ dharmakathayā saṃprakāśayati samādāpayati samuttejayati saṃpraharṣayati sma).And having taught them, made them take it to their hearts, made them rejoice and made them happy, he said to them: “Friends, those of you who wish to listen to religion should go to the True Being in the evening time!” (ye mārṣā dharmaśravaṇkās te ’parāhnakālasamaye tathāgatasya purato gacchantu).As he had said so they left that location, and all went to their separate places.
Then the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī and the son of a banker Bhayadatta went together to the park, where bunches of flowers were spread everywhere, yielding fragrance (pradhūpita), there were awnings (vitānaka) decorated with parasols, banners and ensigns (chattradhvajapatākavibhuṣita).Having prepared riches of food and drink they stayed in the park as they resorted to drums cymbals and songs for amusement (nandakrīḍānulomikatūryatāḍāvacarasaṃgīti).As they had eaten and drunk they got quite intoxicated (pramatta), and the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī fell asleep on a pillow (śīropadhāna) on the lap of Bhayadatta, the son of a banker.Then that girl displayed her body as withered by means of the power of supernormal knowledge, and she produced the concept that she was dead (atha sā dārikābhijñābalena svakāyaṃ mlānaṃ darśayitvā sā maraṇasaṃjñām utpādayati sma).Her whole body became impure and appeared as a rotting corpse, from the two openings of the ears, from the eyes, and from the interior of the nose came ill-smelling impurities and spread all over her body (sarva tasyāḥ kāyo ’śubho ’bhavat, yathā kuṇapam adarśayat, tasyāḥ karṇapuṭayoś cakṣurindriyayoś ca ghrāṇāntarāc ca durgandha utpannaḥ, utpadya ca sarva kāyo vyāptyaḥ).From the interior of her mouth came a foul odour, and the whole park was filled with the odour (tasyāḥ mukhāntarād durgandha utpadyati sma, tair durgandhaiḥ sarva udyāno vyāptaḥ).From every pore flowed blood and pus (sarvaromakupāc ca rudhiraḥ pūyaḥ prasravanti sma), and from the abdomen, with the navel in the middle, the liver and all the intestines appeared (chidrodaraṇābhimadhyād sarvayakṛdantrā utpadyanti sma), excrements and urine appeared from her anus and vulva and flowed out, from her head the brain flowed out, and blue flies began creeping on the nails of her feet and hands (pāyūpasthād uccāraprasrāvaḥ prasravati, mūrdhno mastiṣkaḥ prasravati sma, pādahastāṅguliṣu nīlamakṣikāś calati sma).And Bhayadatta, the son of a banker, saw the body of the girl having turned into such a condition, and having seen it he became taken by fear and became terrified, having no protection and support, no resort, he sought protection, greatly frightened he trembled and cried bitterly (atha śreṣṭhiputro bhayadattas tasyā dārikāyāḥ kāyam evamavasthām āpannaṃ dadarśa, dṛṣṭvā ca bhayārdita udvigno ’śaraṇo ’nāśrayo ’paryāpannaḥ śaraṇaiśī mahābhayabhūtaḥ pravepamāṇaś cakranda).The reasons why such great fear arose in him are two (dvau hetau tanmahābhayotpādasya): He was a person outside religious life, and he had a vision of the crimes which is connected with such fear (pṛthagjana āsīt, tān bhayasya doṣān ca dadarśa).“As recompensation for this girl king Ajātaśatru will kill me”, he thought, and putting the girl off from his lap he tried to escape, but did not manage (sa rājājātaśatrur yāvad asyā dārikāyāḥ pratikāreṇa māṃ haniṣyatīti tāṃ dārikām utsaṅgāt tyaktvā niṣpalāyitum ārabdho nāśaknot).And all his fellows, seeing that great terrible fear, also ran away (tasya parivāro ’pi mahābhīmabhayaṃ dṛṣṭvā niṣpalāyitāḥ).Then, being alone and without friends, he sat down thinking: “Who is going to free me, who is afflicted by such a great fear, from this, a god, a snake god, a meateating demon, a celestial musician, a giant, a divine bird, a man-horse, a great snake, a man, a non-man, a monk or a brahmin?” (atha sa ekāky asahāyaḥ sa subhayabhīto ko māṃ mahābhayabhītam asmān mocayiṣyati devo vā nāgo vā yakṣo vā gandharvo vāsuro vā garuḍo vā kiṃnaro vā mahrago vā mānuṣyo vāmanuṣyo vā bhikṣur vā brāhmaṇo vety asthāt).
That son of a banker, since his roots of good were not yet matured, did not know the teaching which the princely Mañjuśrī had taught that girl, as he had not heard it (aśrutā ca na jñātā tena śreṣṭhiputreṇāparipakvakuśalamūlena mañjuśriyaḥ kumārabhūtasya tasyai dārikāyai dharmakathā).But by the magical presence of the princely Mañjuśrī the the following verses resounded from all the trees in the park (atha mañjuśriyaḥ kumārabhūtasyādhiṣṭhānena sarve tasyodyānasya vṛkṣā gāthā bhāṣanti sma):
1) The whole world is non-existent (abhūta), it is like seeing a magical creation (māyādarśana), but as the boy sees it, the moments of existence has an essential nature (svabhāva).2) That which is clothed (vāsita) in flesh and blood deceives the childish (bāla), and having made thought-constructions (vikalpya) in what is inexistent (abhūta), the foolish (akuśala) and childish become impassioned (rakta).3) Like a foolish man goes along carrying a jar with drawings on the surface, but full of ill-smelling matter,4) while he is walking along, however, it falls down, and seeing the ill-smelling matter, he becomes without any passion (arakta) and runs away, even though having been impassioned before,5) in the same way the childish and foolish become mentally impassioned (rakta) – having made thought-constructions (kalpitvā) of colour, beauty, and appearance they get impassioned by it (rajyante).6) But you, my boy, should understand what is the essential nature of the body (kāyasvabhāva): which wise man is impassioned (rajyate) by the rotten smell from a cementary?7) Do not be afraid: there is no reason to be scared by the non existent (abhūta). You should rather see the essential nature (svabhāva) of the things you were depressed (mūrchita) because of before.8) There is a wonderful teacher of religion who clears away the fear of the scared, a teacher whose name is “The Lion of the Śākyas” has appeared.9) Pleasure (kāma) is impermanent (anitya) and not abiding (adṛḍha), it is like a flash of lightening (vidyutprabhā), though it shines forth it is no real (abhūta), and the wise are not attached to it.10) As bubbles and foam (phenapiṇḍa) arise from troubled water connected to certain causal activity (kāraṇaprayukta) but with no acting subject (kartṛ) there,11) in the same way names and form (nāmarūpa) arise connected to actions (karmaprayukta), since they stem only from such causal activity (kāraṇa), there is no acting subject (kartṛ) there.12) Where is the beautiful colour gone? And where do the impurities by which you were just now so scared come from? That, my boy, you should realize.13) The moments of existence (dharma) are not found in the outside world (viṣaya), and they do not come from any of the directions (pradeśa). But even though they are beyond coming and going (āgatigati), you shoud see their essential nature (svabhāva).14) There is no subject acting (kartṛ) or feeling (vedaka), and the moments of existence being without an acting or feeling subject is like an illusion (māyāvad) and not an existent thing (avastuka).15) Understand your own body in this way, and you should not be scared because of the body of another.16) Just as the amorous play and pleasure in a dream: all amorous pleasure and play (ratikriḍā) is like the amorous play experienced in a dream.17) So, my boy, go to the Lion of the Śākyas, and he will tear you terror and fear (trāsabhaya) up with its roots.18) Your father and mother are not anymore your protection (śaraṇa), and not your friends (mitra) and relatives (bandhu). When they have left you, how can you do what you wish (yathāśaya)?19) So go for protection (śaraṇa) to the One clearing away the fear of the frightened, the Awakened who is the protection of the unprotected (aśaraṇaśaraṇa), and to Religion, and to the elect Assembly.20) Those who go to him for protection – be they from the gods, the celestial musicians or from men – they are liberated from all fear, and happiness is not hard for them to obtain.
Then that son of a banker, having heard those verses, felt happy and rejoiced, and having got rid of his fear, he felt joy, was overjoyed, and, disposing of the rotting corpse (mṛtakuṇapa), he left the park.Then the Lord emitted a ray from his body with the intention of educating that son of a banker, and the whole land of Magadha was filled with that light.The boy saw from a distance the True being, the Saint, the Complete Awakened, looking like the orb of the arising sun, burning with heat and beauty, bringing glory and happiness, with the senses calmed (praśāntendriya), with the mind calmed, well trained, incomparable, having obtained the highest truth, shining like a sacrificial post of gold (suvarṇayūpa), with his senses guarded and controlled like those of an elephant, clear and shining, not turbid like the sea, adorned with the thirty two characteristics of a great man, surrounded by his disciples teaching religion.The way where he was walking was variegated and beautiful to behold, and a railing of gems was set up and flowers were scattered all about.
Then The Powerful One, the King of the Gods, having appeared before that boy, addressed himself to him (śakro devendras tasya dārakasya purataḥ sthitvā taṃ dārakam idam uvāca):Boy, having seen the Tathāgata, your mind will be at ease, and that is really a great attainment (tvaṃ dāraka tathāgataṃ dṛṣṭvā prasannacittaḥ sulabdhalābhaḥ).And the Tathāgata thinks of you, so, boy, do set out on this road and go to the Tathāgata (tathāgatas tvām eva cintayati, tvam dārakedaṃ pantham avatīrya tathāgatasyāntike gaccha)!Then that boy went with The Powerful One, the King of the Gods, to the Lord (atha so dārakaḥ śakro devendreṇa sārddham yena bhagavāṃs tena jagama), and then The Powerful One, the King of the Gods, gave that boy some māndārava flowers saying: “Boy, you should sprinkle these on the Tathāgata,” and then that boy sprinkeled those flowers on the Lord.Having done so, he bowed his head the the feet of the Lord, and circumambulated him three times; then he sat down before the Lord, and he addressed the Lord with the following words:Lord, I take my refuge in the Lord, His Religion and His Community, and this root of good of mine I transform into complete awakening (ahaṃ bhagavantaṃ dharmaṃ ca saṃghaṃ ca śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi, idaṃ ca mama kuśalamūlam anuttarāyai samyaksaṃbodhaye pariṇāmiyiṣyāmi).Lord, I led this famously beautiful girl, approached even by kings, called Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī to the park to have fun and pleasure with her, but suddenly she lost all her colour and her body started to rot (mayā bhagavan suvarṇottamaprabhāśrīr iti janapadakalyāṇī rājādhigatā ratikrīḍāyodyānam ānītā bhagavan sā varṇāpagatā kāyaṃ ca pūtibhūtā).Since all my companions (sarvajñātigaṇa) have left me, I have become very scared (mahābhayajāta), but, Lord, the king is not going to execute me as punishment for this?The Lord said: My boy, do not doubt, in those who have taken their refuge in the Buddha fear does not arise again, so since I have invited you here through absence of fear, do not produce fear!But still, the cause from which fear and terror arise should be given up (kiṃ tarhi dāraka yena nidānena trāsabhayam utpadyate tan nidānaṃ parijahāhi)!The boy said: Lord, what is the cause of fear and terror (kiṃ bhagavaṃs trāsabhayanidānam)?The Lord said: Desire, my boy, aversion and bewilderment are the cause of fear and terror (rāgo dārika dveṣaś ca mohas trāsabhaynidānam); the haughtiness of thinking “I am” is the cause (asmimāno nidānam); being obsessed by doctrinal viewpoints is the cause (dṛṣṭiparyutthānaṃ nidānam); attachment by thirst is the cause (tṛṣṇādhyavasāno nidānam); egotism and self-related ideas are the cause (ahaṃkāro mamakāraś ca nidānam); attachment to things is the cause (vastvabhiniveṣo nidānam); possessions and quarrels are the cause (parigrahavigraho nidānam); the fetters of viewing things as substantially real is the cause (satkāyadīṣṭibandhanaṃ nidānam); the concept of permanence of the impermanent is the cause (anitye nityasaṃjñā nidānam); the concept of happiness where there is suffering is the cause (duḥkhe sukhasaṃjñā nidānam); the concept of beauty where there is ugliness is the cause (aśubhe śubhasaṃjñā nidānam); the concept of self where there is no self is the cause (anātme ātmasaṃjñā nidānam); the concept that there is something to hold on to among the parts of the personality is the cause (skandheṣu parigrahasaṃjñā nidānam); no insight in the spheres of perception is the cause (dhātuṣv apratyavekṣā nidānam); absence of knowledge of the fields of perception is the cause (āyataneṣv aparijñānaṃ nidānam); not seeing the defects of the the body is the cause (kāye ’doṣadarśanatā nidānam); enjoyment of life is the cause (jīvitābhinandanaṃ nidānam); by these causes fear and terror arise, and so they should be done away with (tair nidānair dāraka trāsabhayam utpadyate tena tāni prahātavyāni).
My boy, do you see this perished body of that girl (tvaṃ dāraka tāṃ dārikāyāḥ kāyaṃ paśyasi)? The boy said: Lord, I see it (paśyāmi bhagavan).The Lord said: My boy, all composite things are like that impermanent, filled with suffering and selfless (sarve saṃskṛtā anityā duḥkhitāḥ), they are always changing and unstable (vipariṇāmadharmiṇaś capalāḥ), without eternity (aśāśvatāḥ), deceiving foolish people (bālollopanāḥ), arising from falseness (mithyābūtāḥ), without activity (nirīhakāḥ) and illusory established (viṭhapitāḥ).They are like an illusion because manifested from nothing (māyāsadṛśā abhāvapratibhāsatvāt), they are like a dream because of being a limited kind of enjoyment (svapnasadṛśā alpāsvādanatvāt), they are like a mirage because manifesting from bewilderment (marīcisadṛśā bhrāntipratibhāsatvāt), they are like a reflection because (pratibhāsasadṛśā ādyanutpannatvāt), they are like an image in a mirror because of the fact that they do not perish as a consequence of the ripening of actions (pratibimbasadṛśāḥ karmavipākāvipraṇāśayogatvāt), they are like the reflection of a moon in the water because of the fact that they do not change (udakacandrasadṛśā acyutayogatvāt), they are like an echo because sound is produced from the soundless (pratiśrutkāsadṛśā aśabdaśabdapratipādanatvāt), they are like shadow form because they are the gate of non-production (chāyārūpasadṛśā anabhisaṃskāramukhatvāt), they are like an empty fist because of being empty of essential nature (riktamuṣṭisadṛśāḥ svabhāvavaśikatvāt).They cannot be held on to like the wind (agrāhyā vāyusadṛśāḥ), false, without support, in vain, they do not diminish or increase (mṛṣānālayatucchāhānāpūrṇāḥ).In this way, my boy, all moments of existence are without a controlling self, and you should not be attached to them (evaṃ dārika sarvadharmā asvāmikāḥ, na teṣu tvayābhiniveśaṃ kartavyam).And, my boy, what do you think, how do you look upon your thoughts and reflections connected to your desire (tat kiṃ manyase dārika ye rāgasaṃyuktavitarkavicārāḥ kathaṃ tān paśyasi)?The boy said: The desire of the childish ordinary people arise from imagining a beatiful compelexion and bodily form (bālapṛthagjanānāṃ rāgo bhagavan śubhavarṇsaṃsthānaparikalpād utpadyate), and it does not arise when there is contemplation of the impure and so on as found in the discipline of the noble religion (sa āryadharmavinaye ’sucyādipratyavekṣaṇatayā na bhavati). Lord, if one does not produce thought-constructions of it, the origin of desire does not originate (yadi bhagavan tatra na kalpate na rāgasamudayaḥ samudiyāt).
The Lord said: Very good, very good, my boy, it is like this, not making thought-constructions or conflicting thought-constructions is the essential nature of desire (sādhu sādhu dārika tadyathāyam akalpāvikalpo rāgasvabhāvaḥ).So, my boy, you should practice fundamental mental effort concerning the teachings on the absence of own views, on the absence of others’ views and on the absence of imputing views to others (tvayā dārikānātmadṛṣṭyaparadṛṣṭiparadṛṣṭyasamāropeṣu dharmeṣu yoniśaś cintāyogaḥ karaṇīyaḥ).The boy said: But, Lord, how does the bodhisatva become one practicing fundamental mental effort (kathaṃ bhagavan bodhisatvo yoniśaś cintāyukto bhavet)?The Lord said: My boy, the bodhisatva seeks awakening by means of the essence of desire (bodhisatvo dāraka rāgasvabhāvena bodhiṃ paryeṣati); my boy, the bodhisatva seeks awakening by means of the essence of aversion, the essence of bewilderment, the essence of all the vices (tathā dāraka bodhisatvo dveṣasvabhāvena mohasvabhāvena ca sarvakleśasvabhāvena ca bodhiṃ paryeṣati).My boy, as desire, aversion and bewilderment are non-substantial, in accordance with this is the bodhisatva’s entrance into knowledge (yathā dāraka rāgadveṣamohā avastukās tathā sarvadharmeṣu bodhisatvasya jñānapraveśaḥ).My boy, desire, aversion and bewilderment are without root, and without an abiding-place, without foundation, without an acting or feeling subject,beyond the dicotomy of inner and outer, empty, without self, being, life-principle, life-soul, spirit or personality, without distinguishing marks, without the construdtion of distinguishing marks, without wishful thinking, without pleasure, without passion and thirst, without formative factors (rāgadveṣamohā dārakāmūlakā aniketā anālayā akārakā avedakā adhyātmabāhyaviviktāḥ śūnyā ātmasatvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalarahitā ānimittā nimittakalpanārahitā apraṇidhānā anabhiratayo ratitṛṣṇārahitā anabhisaṃskārā niḥsvabhāvāḥ).My boy, as desire, aversion and bewilderment are unborn, in accordance with this is the bodhisatva’s entrance into knowledge (yathā dāraka rāgadveṣamohā anutpannā tathā sarvadharmeṣu bodhisatvasya jñānapraveśaḥ).Further, my boy, all the thoughts of the bodhisatva practising in the fundamental way are awakening (punar aparaṃ dāraka sarve yoniśo yuktasya bodhisatvasya cittotpādā bodhiḥ). Why (tat kasya hetoḥ)?The understanding of thought is beyond demonstration, beyond wishful thinking, beyond information, like an illusion, not inside, not outside, nor mutually existing, thus formless, and that, exactly, my boy, is the awakening of the bodhisatva (yaś cittāvabodhiḥ so ’nidarśano ’praṇihito ’vijñaptir māyasadṛśo nādhyātmo na bāhyo nānyonyabhāvo ’rūpī, sa eva dāraka bodhisatvasya bodhiḥ).And, my boy, apart from understanding one’s own thoughts there is nothing else the bodhisatva needs to understand (na dāraka kiṃcid anyad bodhisatvena boddhavyaṃ svacittāvabodhād), the understanding of one’s own thought is indeed the understanding of the thought of all beings (yaḥ svacittāvabodhaḥ sa eva sarvasatvānāṃ cittāvabodhaḥ); if one’s own thoughts are standing aloof, the thoughts of all beings are standing aloof (svacittavivekatayā sarvasattvānāṃ cittavivekaḥ), by [understanding] the essence of one’s own thoughts [one understands] the essence of the thoughts of all beings (svacittasvabhāvena sarvasattvānāṃ cittasvabhāvaḥ), if one’s own thoughts are pure, the thoughts of all beings are pure (svacittaviśuddhyā sarvasatvānāṃ cittaviśuddhiḥ), if one’s own thoughts are without desire, the thoughts of all beings are without desire (svacittavirāgena sarvasatvānāṃ cittavirāgaḥ), if one’s own thoughts are witout aversion, the thoughts of all beings are without aversion (svacittādveṣena sarvasatvānāṃ cittādveṣaḥ), if one’s own thoughts are without bewilderment, the thoughts of all beings are without bewilderment (svacittāmohena sarvasatvānāṃ cittāmohaḥ), if one’s own thoughts are without vices, the thoughts of all beings are without vices (svacittaniṣkleśena sarvasatvānāṃ cittaniṣkleśaḥ), such understanding is the understanding of omniscience (ya evamavabodhodaḥ sa sarvajñajñānāvabodhaḥ).Thus the bodhisatva practicing fundamentally, my boy, has the insight that the thoughts of all beings are essentially without vices (evam yoniśaḥprayukto bodhisatvo dāraka sarvasatvānāṃ cittāni svabhāvena niṣkleśāni prajānati).Those who are not stained by vices in their train of thoughts even thought they are occasionally sullied by adventitious vices, in them there is also no fervent desire because of their expanded vision which is in accordance with the true religion (ya āgantukaiḥ kleśair upakliṣṭā api na cittasaṃtāne kliśyante teṣāṃ tatra paridāho ’pi nāsti dharmayuktavipaśyanayā); thus those bodhisatvas are not stained by vices because they see that vices are adventitious (tena te bodhisatvā na saṃkliśyanta āgantukakleśadarśanatvāt).As this teaching was given the son of a banker Bhayadatta attained tolerance in accordance with religion (asmin nirdeśe nirdiśyamāne bhayadattasya śreṣṭiputrasya dharmeṣv anulomikī kṣāntir utpāditā), and as the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī noticed that the son of a banker Bhayadatta had been educated, she, accompanied by about five hundred divine girls, made symbals sound, music heard and songs sung, and she went to the place where the Lord stayed, bowed her head to his feet, and sat down before him.
Then the princely Mañjuśrī addressed himself to the son of a banker Bhayadatta, saying: My boy, do you know this sister? The boy said: Yes, I do. Mañjuśrī said: How do you know her? Then the boy spoke these verses to the princely Mañjuśrī:
1) Beautiful forms (rūpa) are just like a heap of foam (phenapiṇḍa), feelings (vedanā) are just like bubbels (budbuda), concepts (saṃjñā) are like a mirage (marīci), the formative principles (saṃskāra) are like the soft plantaintree (kadalī),2) and consciousness (vijñāna) is just like an illusion (māyā); they are all born from fantasies (parikalpāt), and I know her as an inexistent thought-construction (abhūtakalpita) of a child.3) The body itself is inactive (aniñja), it is dead matter (mūrkha), like grass and stones (tṛṇakudya); consciousness (vijñāna) is impossible to display (anidarśana); this is the way I know her.4) In it is no being (satva), no self (ātman), no life principle (jīva), no person (pudgala), this body is just a heap; this is the way I know her.5) In it is no desire (rāga), aversion (dveṣa) or bewilderment (moha), no vice (kleśa) and no purification (viśuddhi); this is the way I know her.6) In superficial (ayoniśaḥ) teachings there is childish confusion (bhrānti), to this the wise are not attached (asakta); this is the way I know her.7) Just like an ill-smelling corpse lying in the jungle, this form has a similar nature (svabhāva); this is the way I know her.8) It is unborn in the beginning (pūrvāntānutpanna), not perishing in the end (aparāntācyuta) and inexistent in the present (pratyutpannābhūta); this is the way I know her.9) After having been stupified (saṃmūrcchita) by it I have been liberated by the impure (aśubha), so, Mañjughoṣa, what this is about, I am not really able to answer.10) Though there is really no death (maraṇa), really no transmigration (cyuti), I am still manifesting that I am dying for the sake of maturing living beings (satvaparipācanāya), so that no one will not seek awakening (bodhi).11) As my desire (rāga) and aversion (dveṣa) and all my vices (kleśa) are something superficial (ayoniśas), such is also the character (lakṣaṇa) of all beings, this is the reality of all things (iyaṃ dharmāṇāṃ dharmatā).
Then the Lord smiled. This is the nature of the Awakened Ones: When they smile, light of many various colours appears from the opening of their mouth, blue, yellow, red, white, rosy, crystal, and the colour of silver. As it appeared it reached all the way to the heaven of Brahma, and it penetrated innumerable world spheres with light, and returning it was absorbed into the top of the head (uṣṇīṣa) of the Lord.Then the Venerable Ānanda, having seen the Lord smile, went up to his feet and put his cloak over the shoulder and placing the right knee on the ground he bowed his head as he joined his palms in veneration in the direction of the Lord, addressing the Lord as follows:The Tathāgatas, the Arhats, the completely Awakened ones do not smile without a specific reason and cause, so, Lord, what is the reason, what is the cause, why you smiled? Then he spoke the following verses:
1) The leader, the knower of the world, for whom there is no false doctrine, the teacher does not smile without a cause. Thus, since you have smiled, we request you earnestly: What is the cause of your smile?2) Having seen the smile of the victorious doubt has arisen in the world including the gods. So we ask you to clear away the uncertainty of the doubtful, you best of men, please demonstrate to us the cause why you smile.3) Who are the ones having set their minds on religion? Who are the ones who in reality have been seen by the Victorious Ones? Who are those having today made offerings to and praised the Awakened One? This is what we wish to hear.4) Who are the ones having defeated Māra and his flock? By whom have the mind of the of our teacher been satisfied today? Who have understood the depth of the conditioned things today? We ask you to hear that, please clear away our doubts.5) All the world praises you with the palms of their hands joined because they want to hear why our leader smiled. You best of beings with two feet, produce compassion and please clear away the perplexity of doubtfulness.
The Lord said: Ānanda, do you see this daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī? Ānanda said: Yes, Lord, I see her, I see her, Sugata.The Lord said: Ānanda, before this the princely Mañjuśrī inspired this daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī to completely grasp the incomparable complete awakening (iyam ānanda suvarṇottaraprabhāśrī gaṇikāduhitā pūrvaṃ mañjuśriyā kumārabhūtenānuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhiṃ samādāpayitum avatāritā), and she, having heard about religion from him, produced the kind of tolerance which is in accordance with all things (asyās dharmaṃ tasmāc chrutvā dharmeṣv anulomikī kṣāntir utpāditā).The Lord said: Ānanda, do you see this son of a banker Bhayadatta? Ānanda said: Yes, Lord, I see him, I see him, Sugata.The Lord said: Ānanda, before this I inspired this son of a banker Bhayadatta to completely grasp the incomparable complete awakening (ayam ānanda bhayadattaḥ śreṣṭhiputraḥ pūrvaṃ mayā samyaksaṃbodhiṃ samādāpayitum avatāritaḥ), and he, having heard about religion from me, produced the kind of tolerance which is in accordance with all things (asya dharmaṃ mac chrutvā dharmeṣv anulomikī kṣāntir utpāditā).Ānanda, in a world age ninety-two times hundred thousand world ages from now called Ratnasaṃbhava, this daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī will reach complete awakening in a world sphere called Ratna, and will be tathāgata, an arhat, a fully awakened one called Ratnaprabha. And, Ānanda, the enjoyment and delight of the beings in that world sphere will be like that of the class of thirty three gods. There will be no other jewels there but the bodhisatva-jewels, and the life of that tathāgata will be immeasurable.And during the life of this completely awakened this son of a banker Bhayadatta will be born as a bodhisatva called Guṇaratnaprabha, and he will do the work of keeping the religious collection of the tathāgata.At the time when the tathāgata Ratnaprabha reaches the final extinction he will pronounce the following prophecy for that bodhisatva Guṇaprabha: This bodhisatva Guṇaprabha will reach the complete awakening after me, and will be tathāgata, an arhat, a fully awakened one called Ratnārcis. The display of his buddha-field will be about like mine.As soon as the prophecy had been spoken for the two of them, for the courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī and for the son of a banker Bhayadatta, at that opportunity this world system of three thousandfold worlds was shaken in its six forms of existence, and the worlds were radiated by a grand lustre. And as that prophecy was set forth, a hundred thousand beings produced the thought that they would reach the incomparable complete awakening.
Then the Venerable Ānanda addressed himself to the Lord: Lord, what is the name of this expostion of religion? How should it be adopted?The Lord said: Ānanda, this is why you should adopt this exposition of religion as “The chapter on the gate into the great display” (mahāvyūhamukhaparivarta), you should adopt it as “The miraculous play of Mañjuśrī” (mañjuśrīvikrīḍita), you should adopt it as “The education of the daugther of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī” (suvarṇottamaprabhāśrīgaṇikāduhitāvinaya).As the Lord had uttered these words, the venerable Ānanda, the courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī, the son of a banker Bhayadatta, the princely Mañjuśrī, those great beings the bodhisatvas and all their retinue, and the world with gods, men giants celestial musicians were overjoyed and they praised what the Lord had spoken.
